## [1.3.34] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- **Manual Codex OAuth Token refresh**: refresh an account's credentials from the account overview and review the result, failure reason, retry, or reauthorization action in a dedicated dialog.
- **Account-pool diagnostics**: when no account can handle a request, the account-pool dialog explains the selection result and provides recovery actions.
- **Per-account image-generation policy**: API Service account pools can enable or disable image generation for individual accounts without affecting text requests.

### Changed

- **Unified Codex authentication flow**: account overview, default and managed instances, API Service, and API Key OAuth bindings now use the same credential preparation, refresh, reauthorization, progress, and result handling.
- **Client authorization state is informational**: an observed client login-page redirect no longer blocks switching or API Service use; an explicit upstream authorization revocation remains the highest-priority state.
- **OAuth authorization follows the official desktop entry point** and remains usable without a local Codex client; browser authorization now allows up to 10 minutes, and the client-version default can be managed remotely, cached locally, or overridden in Settings.
- **Profile isolation and quota refresh efficiency**: API Service and managed instances keep independent provider gateways, while batch quota refresh reduces repeated process probing and request contention.
- **Launch actions are recoverable**: users can cancel, retry, reauthorize, or skip eligible non-blocking failures from the active launch dialog.
- **Subscription information is labeled as “Subscription validity”** so it is distinct from Token expiration.

### Fixed

- **Fixed stale OAuth credentials being restored after reauthorization, switching, quota refresh, or profile synchronization**, preventing accounts from reverting to an older Token.
- **Fixed client login-page observations leaving stale or delayed account-card state**: the account overview now updates the recorded client status promptly and keeps it separate from API authorization failures.
- **Fixed account-pool errors being hidden after dispatch failures**: unavailable-account results now retain pool diagnostics and display localized recovery information in the account-pool dialog.
- **Fixed API 401 results being shown as API Service available**: the account status now reflects an actual upstream rejection.
- **Fixed account cards remaining in a loading state after cancelling a switch**.
- **Fixed text requests being rejected solely because image generation is unavailable**, and corrected affected controls that displayed browser-native gray button styles.

## [1.3.33] - 2026-08-27

### Changed

- **The account overview and managed instances now share the same Codex client launch experience**: “Switch and launch” from the account overview, the default instance, and managed instances now use the same launch progress and authentication-result presentation, including consistent `access_token` and `id_token` expiration, refresh, and reauthorization states. Authorization or launch failures can be retried from the same dialog, and the original launch resumes after reauthorization succeeds.

## [1.3.32] - 2026-08-26

### Changed

- **Codex OAuth accounts are no longer restricted by cross-instance occupancy**: the same account can be used by the default instance, managed instances, API Key bindings, and API Service without being blocked merely because another instance is using it.
- **Switching the default Codex instance is safer**: concurrent changes from development and production builds now report a conflict immediately, preventing one environment from reverting a switch completed by the other. API Service now closes the official client still using the default instance before taking it over.
- **Codex launch preview now shows OAuth token expirations**: standard OAuth accounts display the local expiration and relative remaining time for both `access_token` and `id_token`, including clear near-expiry and expired states.
- **Automatic quota refresh now processes accounts in sequence**: manual batch refresh keeps its existing concurrency, while background refresh uses a steadier request pace to reduce short bursts of rate limiting and connection contention.
- **Codex experimental-model context presets now use compact labels**: preset values and compaction thresholds use a shorter format to reduce crowding in the model editor dialog.

### Fixed

- **Fixed older Codex OAuth credentials overwriting newer tokens**: account switching, reauthorization, instance launch, and local credential synchronization now prefer newer valid credentials, preventing an account from reverting to stale tokens and encountering remote revocation or sign-in failure again.
- **Fixed Codex clients starting with an expired `id_token` and then redirecting to sign-in**: default instances, managed instances, and API Key accounts bound to OAuth now refresh an expired or near-expiry `id_token` before launch. If no valid token can be obtained, the shared reauthorization flow is shown; managed-instance flows open the OAuth dialog directly and resume the original instance after authorization succeeds.
- **Fixed authorization state becoming inconsistent after binding OAuth to a Codex API Key or API Service**: bound accounts now show authorization issues with a direct reauthorize action, and reauthorized credentials are synchronized to API Service. Accounts with a usable `access_token` remain available to API Service and are not counted as failed accounts.
- **Fixed stale account state remaining visible after OAuth reauthorization**: the account list, current account, and API Service binding state update immediately after authorization and can no longer be restored to their pre-authorization state by an older response that finishes later.
- **Fixed Codex client launch failures still being reported as a successful account switch or API Service activation**: launch failures now retain a clear error result and retry action instead of treating a completed credential change as proof that the client is usable.
- **Fixed Codex local import sometimes using stale OAuth credentials**: OAuth accounts are imported from the official credential store, including macOS Keychain, while API Key, Agent Identity, and personal access token imports retain their existing behavior.
- **Fixed Codex API Service text tests being blocked by image-capability checks for some accounts**: ordinary text tests no longer advertise image-generation tools to upstreams without image capacity, while actual image-generation requests remain unaffected.
- **Fixed Codex batch quota refresh repeatedly probing desktop processes on Windows**: a refresh batch reuses one runtime detection result, reducing PowerShell subprocesses and avoidable waits.

## [1.3.31] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- **Fixed deleted Codex accounts reappearing and reauthorization continuing with stale credentials**: deletion now remains authoritative even when an older quota or profile task finishes later, successful empty account lists clear the local UI cache, and newly authorized credentials cannot be overwritten by an older account snapshot or the previous live `auth.json`. Deleting and authorizing the same account again now keeps the new Token and no longer causes a stale-credential 401 during the following switch.
- **Fixed the official account check affecting Codex instance startup**: `accounts/check` now runs only for actual account switches, including the automatic continuation after OAuth reauthorization; starting an existing instance keeps the previous local credential preparation behavior and is no longer turned into a 401 reauthorization failure by this check.
- **Fixed image generation being unavailable in the new Codex API Service version**: conflict handling is restored when the official `image_gen` tool and hosted `image_generation` tool are both present, including top-level tools, nested `additional_tools`, historical `response` metadata, and `tool_choice`. HTTP, streaming, and Responses WebSocket requests now select the correct image capability instead of sending both tool systems and being rejected upstream.
- **Fixed the API Service experimental model catalog preemptively blocking image generation**: when the selected accounts have OAuth image-generation capacity, the gateway restores `gpt-image-2` visibility even if the experimental model catalog omits it, then continues normal account routing; the model remains hidden when capacity is unavailable or explicit model filters exclude it.
- **Fixed non-image tool compatibility for Codex Responses Lite and WebSocket requests**: Lite catalog detection and recursive filtering are restored for `function`, `custom`, client-side `tool_search`, namespaces, and `allowed_tools`, while unsupported `web_search`, server-side `tool_search`, empty tool choices, and invalid input namespaces are removed. HTTP and WebSocket requests now behave consistently, preserving collaboration and other supported tools after the proxy refactor.
- **Fixed Payload rules not matching Gemini CLI sources**: the `gemini-cli` source protocol is normalized to `gemini` again, so existing Gemini-scoped default, override, and filter rules continue to apply.
- **Fixed Cursor API usage being hidden in the floating card**: the floating card now shows Cursor's three primary quota bars—Total Usage, Auto + Composer, and API Usage—without changing the two-bar limit for other platforms.

## [1.3.30] - 2026-08-25

### Changed

- **Codex account switching and multi-instance launch checks now follow the official client**: client availability is based on a usable `access_token` and the official account-check result; refresh is attempted only when the access token is invalid or the official check explicitly returns unauthorized. The `id_token` is no longer a switch or launch gate, preventing an expired identity metadata token from incorrectly blocking an account.
- **Account-usage conflicts can now be dismissed directly**: when an OAuth account is already running in another instance, the conflict dialog provides both a Close action and a top-right close button; dismissing it only closes the prompt and never stops, focuses, or transfers an instance.

## [1.3.29] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- **Codex adds a unified launch preview**: before starting OAuth accounts, API Keys, or the local API Service from the account overview or instance manager, users can review account, quota, usage, and target-instance status in one dialog, switch the target instance and runtime speed, manage visible and default models plus per-model reasoning, context, and compaction settings, repair session visibility, and use common account actions. Account launches can explicitly choose Switch or Switch and Start, and client state changes only after confirmation.
- **Codex history now supports full provider migration and catalog repair**: migrate provider metadata across `sessions` and `archived_sessions`, update provider, user-event, workspace-path, and local-catalog records across all session SQLite databases, restore missing catalog rows, remove accidental sub-agent entries, normalize global workspace state, and warn when encrypted history may not continue across providers. Preview, selected-session, and multi-instance scopes remain available, with rollback backups and stopped-target protection before writes.
- **Codex accounts now support device-code authorization**: choose browser OAuth or device auth at any time, open the Codex security setting when device codes need to be enabled, enter the verification code, and let Cockpit complete sign-in and account setup without using local callback port `1455`. Browser and device authorization also request the read and invoke scopes required by Codex Connectors.
- **Codex API Service now supports Live and Realtime APIs**: create WebRTC calls, connect sideband and Realtime WebSockets, issue client secrets, create sessions and transcription sessions, translate Realtime content, and control calls with hangup, accept, reject, and refer operations.
- **Codex API Service adds expanded request and conversation capabilities**: requests can use HTTP/SSE or Responses WebSocket transport, preserve reasoning replay across turns, run Multi-Agent V2 workloads, and expose the expanded Codex model catalog.

### Changed

- **Codex quick session repair now follows the official sidebar visibility rules**: it checks only the target instance's official `state_5.sqlite` and referenced rollouts, filters by the active provider, active state, preview, rollout path, and root-session source, fills missing previews for visible sessions, and avoids scanning or rewriting archived, sub-agent, or unrelated history files.
- **Codex session-repair provider discovery is now faster**: target-provider candidates are read only from each instance's `config.toml` and official `state_5.sqlite`; opening the repair dialog no longer scans rollout files under `sessions` or `archived_sessions`.

### Fixed

- **Fixed Linux installers being missing from the official Release**: fixed a Linux-target compilation failure in Codex desktop process detection, restoring AppImage, deb, and rpm release builds for both x86_64 and aarch64.
- **Fixed standalone OAuth launches being reported as expired after that OAuth account was bound to an API Key account**: combined profiles now retain the actual OAuth credential owner and recover the latest tokens rotated by the official client before launch. Unbinding, rebinding, or moving between stable, development, and managed instances no longer causes an old `refresh_token` to be reused and rejected as `refresh_token_reused`, while the original API Key provider configuration remains intact.
- **Fixed Codex API Service usage being duplicated across members of the same Team/Workspace**: account-window statistics now use Cockpit's local account ID, so multiple local accounts that share one upstream `account_id` keep separate request and token totals.
- **Fixed abnormal Codex API Key accounts showing generated `api-key-xxxx` identifiers instead of custom titles**: the account health dialog now prefers the manually assigned account name and falls back to the generated identifier only when no custom name is configured.
- **Fixed quota refreshes being misreported as account errors while the official ChatGPT/Codex client is running**: quota queries now require only a valid `access_token` and no longer rotate the `refresh_token` because the `id_token` is nearing expiry or a proactive keepalive interval elapsed. When the official client owns the RT, Cockpit can still fetch current quota with a valid AT; if a newer AT must be awaited, the previous quota is retained without exposing the internal RT-ownership notice or marking the account as a quota failure.

## [1.3.28] - 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- **Fixed account switching for the official ChatGPT/Codex desktop app on Linux/Ubuntu and completed its instance lifecycle support**: Cockpit detects the official `chatgpt` installation and applies the same transactional credential checks and refresh, occupancy protection, desktop-runtime shutdown, profile-service shutdown, credential writes, and relaunch used on macOS and Windows. Managed instances use isolated `CODEX_HOME` and Electron user-data directories, can be detected and stopped independently, and can be focused when Linux window-control tools are available.
- **Codex CLI mode no longer closes the official desktop client by mistake**: when CLI mode is explicitly selected, switching accounts and starting, stopping, or closing all instances manages only the associated profile services and configuration; App mode on macOS, Windows, and Linux continues to manage the official desktop runtime.
- **Fixed Trae Work CN / Trae Solo CN accounts being overwritten by stale local sessions or classified as Trae CN**: runtime sessions now synchronize tokens only when the platform matches while preserving the OAuth platform, host, scope, device-key, and ExchangeToken context. Non-running `storage.json` snapshots participate only when they are newer than the saved credentials, preventing platform drift and loss of the current refresh flow.
- **Fixed Trae Work CN accounts being reclassified as Trae CN after refresh**: runtime snapshots after OAuth now synchronize tokens only when account identity, platform, and credential freshness match. Stale `storage.json` data can no longer replace `platformId`, callback metadata, device keys, or Exchange context, and snapshots from another Trae platform are rejected explicitly to prevent reclassification or invalidating the current authentication flow.

### Added

- **Windows system operations now use a unified recovery dialog**: when account switching, instance lifecycle actions, API Service sidecars, port cleanup, backups, or exports encounter access denial, `os error 5`, file-in-use errors, or missing programs, a top-level dialog shows the original cause and redacted details with retry, manual-resolution, open-location, and copy-error actions. Supported client processes can continue through one-time Windows authorization within a restricted safety boundary, while non-critical background probes remain silent.

### Changed

- **Official release builds now use more parallel execution**: macOS Universal builds alongside the platform packages, checksum and Homebrew finalization run in parallel, and Cask PRs that are already mergeable no longer fail during auto-merge, reducing wait times for later releases.

## [1.3.27] - 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- **Fixed Windows Codex account switching being blocked by system permissions**: restored the stable official-client close and launch path without directly invoking the internal WindowsApps `codex.exe app-server daemon stop`, preventing “Access denied (os error 5)” or an unavailable PowerShell executable from aborting the switch.

## [1.3.26] - 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- **Fixed Windows account switching failing in the new Codex version**: fixed the official `Codex app-server daemon stop` step failing with “Access denied (os error 5)” for `codex.exe` under WindowsApps, which prevented the account switch from continuing.

## [1.3.25] - 2026-08-23

### Changed

- **Codex account switching and reauthorization are more reliable**: resolved cases where switching required another login or newly authorized account state and credentials did not take effect; after authorization, the original account switch or instance launch can continue.
- **Codex client authorization is now evaluated separately from API Service availability**: when the client needs reauthorization but the API token still works, the account remains available to API Service and is not counted as invalid.
- **Codex multi-instance launches now protect account occupancy**: the same OAuth account cannot be used by multiple official instances at once; you can locate the active instance, choose another account, or transfer account use.
- **Codex API Service now recovers automatically from local port conflicts**: when the original port is unavailable, the service selects another local port while keeping accounts, API keys, and pool settings intact.
- **Behavior backups now use bounded retention**: Claude, Codex, WorkBuddy, CodeBuddy, and related session and configuration repair backups keep the newest copy per source and instance instead of consuming disk space indefinitely.

### Fixed

- **Fixed Codex API Service streaming conversations hanging and identities leaking across conversations**: streaming responses now finish cleanly and each conversation keeps an independent session identity.
- **Fixed Codex API Service stats resetting after an account is added again**: usage is attributed by the official Codex account ID, so request counts, token usage, and account cost remain after reauthorizing or re-importing the same official account.
- **Fixed Codex default-instance detection and lifecycle failures**: the default instance and its background processes can now be detected, started, and closed correctly.
- **Fixed Codex instances with WebSocket disabled repeatedly attempting WebSocket connections**: API Service now preserves each instance's current WebSocket setting.

### Added

- **Grok account switches can sync OpenCode sign-in**: optionally sync OpenCode when switching Grok accounts and restart OpenCode so the new account takes effect immediately; accounts using custom third-party endpoints do not overwrite the existing sign-in. Thanks @FB208 ([#2002](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/2002)).
- **Backup storage can now be moved to another drive**: macOS and Windows users can choose a new local backup folder in Settings; existing backups remain available after migration, with storage usage visible and cleanable by source.
- **Codex accounts can be exported as official `auth.json` files**: OAuth, API Key, and Agent Identity accounts are exported in their corresponding formats, with separate files for multiple accounts.
- **Codex model catalogs now support per-model context windows and compact limits**: each model can use defaults or custom values, synchronized for both the Codex client and API Service.

## [1.3.24] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- **Fixed account switching with the latest Codex release and aligned it with the current official authentication flow**: before replacing the active credentials, Cockpit saves the current account's latest official auth state; the default file store reads `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`, while explicitly configured `keyring` / `auto` stores use the matching `Codex Auth` entry. Account switches are serialized, and rewritten OAuth auth files preserve unrelated official or custom fields while removing stale account credentials, reducing cases where switching back requires another login.

### Changed

- **Codex OAuth login and token refresh now use the official credential-facing client identity**: token exchange and refresh requests send the matching `originator` and `User-Agent` pair used by the official client.
- **The Codex launch-after-switch setting now sits with the Codex App launch path**: its description also makes clear that enabling it starts or restarts Codex App after an account switch.

## [1.3.23] - 2026-08-19

### Changed

- **Codex OAuth device fingerprint defaults to Session again and isolates API Service identity per account**: accounts that were not explicitly set to Device or Full use Session; accounts that 1.3.22 switched to Off on upgrade also return to Session. Session mode issues a stable installation / session / thread / turn identity per account and rewrites parent/fork lineage plus workspace paths, Git remotes, and commits so local accounts do not share one environment identity. After startup, the local API service is synced away from the previous default-off write; Off / Device / Full can still be chosen manually.
- **Codex Business monthly credits now show as a single remaining line**: when credits remain, the card shows `Credits: amount` without a progress bar; the row is hidden when remaining is 0.
- **Disabled the top-right promotional ad**.

### Fixed

- **Linux can resolve and launch Antigravity correctly**: configured paths, `PATH`, install-root and `bin/` layouts, and the user-local `~/.local/share/antigravity-ide` install are supported, with execute-permission checks; Debian packages now include `libsecret-tools` because official credential switching calls `secret-tool`. Thanks @KirschBluteX ([#1944](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1944)).

## [1.3.22] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- **Codex now supports visible-model catalog management**: the new version migrates older catalogs once to the shipped official visible-model list; afterward, models can be added, edited, or removed in a dedicated manager, with each model following official reasoning levels or using a custom reasoning-effort set, and any visible model can be marked as the default. The setting remains consistent across the default profile, extra instances, and account switches while respecting user-managed catalogs.
- **Added Codex OAuth client policies**: use the Codex top-right Settings popover to enable app-server access, then configure official-client-only access, app-server access, and device-fingerprint mode in bulk or per OAuth account; changes are synchronized to the local API service.
- **macOS launch terminals now include Ghostty**: Claude CLI and Codex CLI can open directly in Ghostty. Thanks @Jonesxq ([#1948](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1948)).
- **Codex terminals can launch on Linux**: the system terminal is used first, then gnome-terminal and konsole. Thanks @Jonesxq ([#1950](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1950)).

### Changed

- **Visible models in Codex settings now use a read-only summary**: the main settings dialog only shows the current list; click “Manage” to edit model IDs, display names, and reasoning efforts in a dedicated dialog, keeping the main settings surface compact.
- **Codex OAuth device fingerprint now defaults to Off for everyone**: existing accounts are switched to Off on upgrade; Session / Device / Full can still be turned back on manually.
- **Codex OAuth fingerprint and client policies are managed from the Codex Settings popover**: fingerprint convergence now supports Off / Device / Session / Full and is synchronized with the local API service without blocking the settings page.
- **Codex API Service now runs through the sidecar gateway**: the legacy gateway option and its legacy-only timeout fields are retired, and existing legacy collections migrate to the sidecar mode automatically.
- **Codex API Service default estimates now match the public price book**: `gpt-5.6-luna` is $0.2 / $0.02 / $1.2 and `gpt-5.6-terra` is $2 / $0.2 / $12 (input / cached-read / output per million tokens). Accounts that still used the previous defaults pick up the new rates; later requests are estimated with the new prices, and existing stats are left unchanged.
- **API Service usage on Codex account cards is shown only after the account joins the pool**: request count, tokens, and account cost stay hidden until then.
- **Interface scaling now supports smaller sizes down to 30%**, making dense settings and management pages usable in smaller windows.
- **The bundled CLIProxyAPI source path is now `sidecars/cockpit-cliproxy/third_party/CLIProxyAPI`**: the previous `cdk/CLIProxyAPI` directory has been replaced; local sidecar builds should use the new path.

### Fixed

- **Selecting a MiniMax preset now keeps image-input support**: only `MiniMax-M3` accepts images; `MiniMax-M2.7` stays text-only. Thanks @octo-patch ([#1968](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1968)).
- **Codex Business accounts can show monthly credits**: remaining amount, total, and reset time are parsed and displayed. Thanks @Jonesxq ([#1953](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1953)).
- **macOS API Service sidecars no longer inherit the Cockpit app identity**: LAN gateway access no longer fails for that reason. Thanks @Jonesxq ([#1947](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1947)).
- **Menu-bar quota keeps refreshing after close-to-tray**: when menu-bar quota is enabled, the main window is hidden instead of tearing down the WebView. Thanks @Jonesxq ([#1952](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1952)).

## [1.3.21] - 2026-08-15

### Added

- **Codex now supports an optional experimental model catalog**: add and edit experimental model IDs and display names for the default profile and extra instances, with `gpt-5.6-sol-wm` / `GPT-5.6 Sol WM` provided initially. Custom experimental models are available in the Codex client and Cockpit API Service; the setting stays enabled across account-type switches and respects user-managed model catalogs.
- **Delimited Antigravity account imports support auxiliary email addresses and Google refresh tokens**: a valid refresh token can restore the signed-in account directly, while missing or invalid tokens still preserve the password, auxiliary email, and 2FA details as a pending profile. Account exports preserve the auxiliary email as well.

### Changed

- **Codex settings are flatter and save immediately**: the config file, context presets, custom values, experimental models, account-switch integrations, quota display, and auto-switch controls now share the outer settings level; presets, fields, and switches persist without separate Save or Refresh buttons, and consecutive edits are saved in order.

## [1.3.20] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- **Codex MiniMax Token Plan and Zhipu/GLM Coding Plan accounts can now show quota**: refresh to see remaining percentage, plan, and reset time. Thanks @Jonesxq ([#1929](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1929)).
- **Codex model providers add OpenCode Go, and OpenRouter includes the Luna Pro model**: OpenCode Go can be selected as a Chat Completions provider with its current model catalog. Thanks @Jonesxq ([#1922](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1922)).
- **Existing Codex model-provider API keys can be edited in place**: the provider entry stays, and linked Codex accounts pick up the new key. Thanks @Jonesxq ([#1923](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1923)).

### Changed

- **Considering long titles such as Codex Spark, the account quota layout was adjusted**: the title sits above the bar so progress bars stay aligned.
- **DeepSeek in Codex now exposes its real reasoning levels**: `low` / `high` / `max`, instead of Codex default `medium` / `xhigh`. Thanks @Jonesxq ([#1931](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1931)).

### Fixed

- **Closed guides, account groups, and custom sort now survive updates**: dismissed gateway / risk / sidebar prompts are stored on disk, old localStorage keys still count as dismissed, and incomplete account lists no longer wipe group members or custom order. Group files also fail closed and write atomically. Thanks @Jonesxq ([#1933](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1933), [#1919](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/issues/1919)).
- **CodeBuddy CN and WorkBuddy enterprise accounts now show real usage**: when the personal resource API returns empty, the official enterprise usage API is used. Thanks @Yuyang-0423 ([#1911](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1911)).
- **Provider usage lookup now works when the base URL is only a host root**: the configured URL is tried first, then `/v1`. Thanks @Jonesxq ([#1926](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1926)).
- **Switching Codex to the built-in OpenAI provider no longer overwrites a user-selected unmanaged `model_provider`**. Thanks @Jonesxq ([#1930](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1930)).
- **WorkBuddy scheduled check-ins now fire more reliably**: the scheduler wakes after config changes, checks once at startup, and retries when the activity is temporarily closed. Thanks @Jonesxq ([#1932](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1932)).
- **Codex API Service request logs now record reasoning effort**. Thanks @Jonesxq ([#1924](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1924)).

## [1.3.19] - 2026-08-14

### Changed

- **Codex account quota labels are now short and stay on one line**: `5h` / `7d` / `5w`, model-specific windows like `Spark 7d`, and Code Review as a short label. Full names remain in the hover tooltip.

## [1.3.18] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- **Codex third-party model catalogs support a per-model context window**: set it on the model list when adding or editing an API Key, in the model-provider editor, or on the API Service mapping table. Official and DeepSeek catalogs keep vendor values unless you enter one; other models fall back to Compact settings or 128000. After saving, both the Codex client catalog and the API Service model list report that window; restart Codex to apply it there.
- **First launch and post-update startup show a progress bar**: the window no longer stays blank while the app is loading.
- **Codex account cards show usage from the last full window to now**: official accounts in the API Service pool display request count, tokens, and account-billed cost (`A $`); empty windows still show `0 req`, `0`, and `A $0.00`.
- **Codex session management adds session usage**: real token usage is aggregated from local session logs, independent of official remaining-quota percentages and without requiring traffic to go through API Service.

### Changed

- **Official Codex quota bars are now compact, with reset time on its own line aligned to the quota label**.
- **Codex API Service official OAuth outbound identity now matches official clients**: paired `codex-tui` identity is used by default and downstream client user-agents are not forwarded; session headers use `Session-Id` and include window and thread identifiers.

### Fixed

- **Fixed the app appearing frozen on a white screen after install or update**: startup now shows progress, and first paint no longer waits on remote fonts.

## [1.3.17] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- **Codex model providers support native DeepSeek Responses**: use DeepSeek Flash / Pro directly in Codex with the official Responses API by default; Chat Completions is still available when needed, and eligible accounts can view their balance. Thanks @usertianziyang for providing some of the ideas ([#1839](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1839)).
- **Codex OAuth accounts support device fingerprint modes**: choose Session / Device / Full / Off per account or in batch, with Session as the default; other account types such as API Key are unaffected.
- **Codex API Service client keys support an optional total token budget**: set a total token limit per client key and refuse further calls once it is used up; keys without a limit stay unlimited. Thanks @ndhao164 ([#1870](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1870)).
- **WorkBuddy supports a per-account built-in browser**: open pages like the growth center in a separate window so account logins never mix. Thanks @xhrxgr ([#1896](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1896)).
- **WorkBuddy auto check-in now runs in the background**: scheduled check-ins continue when the main window is closed and only the tray stays running. Thanks @xdd666t ([#1772](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1772)).
- **Trae accounts support optional auto check-in**: set a per-account schedule, off by default, with no impact on normal account use. Thanks @xhrxgr ([#1834](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1834)).
- **Antigravity accounts support local profile details**: save notes, 2FA, password, phone number, and a mail inbox for verification codes; fields can be pre-filled before authorization, and export can include or omit sensitive data.
- **Adding or editing a Codex API Key can reuse an existing key from the same provider**: a new key can still be entered manually.
- **Codex API Service accounts can be removed directly from the account list**: members no longer need to be managed inside the service panel.

### Changed

- **WorkBuddy merges existing local sessions when session sharing on switch is enabled**: conversation history is far less likely to disappear after an account switch. Thanks @xhrxgr ([#1880](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1880)).
- **Antigravity local account data is now encrypted as a whole file**: existing accounts migrate automatically on first read, and original data remains intact.
- **Codex API Service stability improved for multi-turn chats and streaming replies**.

### Fixed

- **Fixed some API Key providers being unable to keep WebSocket connections**: providers with WebSocket enabled can now maintain a stable real-time connection.
- **Fixed custom relays with WebSocket explicitly disabled being switched back to the official connection path**: the relay setting is now respected. Thanks @yaobii-lab ([#1867](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1867)).
- **Fixed local API services on other ports being rejected as upstreams**: a local API service on any port can now be used as the upstream.
- **Fixed Sub2API imports turning full OAuth accounts into access-token-only accounts**: the full OAuth login state is preserved after import. Thanks @Jonesxq ([#1886](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1886)).
- **Fixed custom API Key names disappearing in the Codex account overview and related flows**: custom names are now displayed correctly. Thanks @andrew05060414 ([#1817](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1817)).
- **Fixed Codex API Service incorrectly reporting a missing model when request compression is enabled**: compression no longer triggers false missing-model warnings. Thanks @DragonLingLuo ([#1836](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1836)).
- **Fixed Multi-Agent collaboration treating encrypted messages as plain task text**: collaboration messages are now handled correctly.
- **Fixed namespaced tool calls failing on the second turn of a conversation**: tool calls can now continue across multiple turns. Thanks @Jonesxq ([#1887](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1887)).
- **Fixed thinking Chat providers rejecting multi-turn Codex conversations**: thinking providers can now handle multi-turn conversations normally.

## [1.3.16] - 2026-08-02

### Added

- **Codex `at-*` personal-access-token accounts can set a ChatGPT Workspace ID**: Token / JSON imports recognize `account_id`, camelCase fields, and `ChatGPT-Account-Id` in headers / custom headers; the account-note dialog can view, copy, and edit the Team / Workspace UUID, then persist it and synchronize it to the API Service sidecar. When no real workspace ID is available, Cockpit no longer substitutes its local account ID as the upstream account ID.
- **Codex sub2api export supports API Key and access-token-only accounts**: API Key accounts use native sub2api `apikey` credentials; access-token-only accounts carry the real token expiry and enable automatic pause on expiry; OAuth exports include the official client ID, user and organization identity, login provider, access-token and subscription expiry, with default concurrency 3 and priority 50.

### Changed

- **Codex API Service transparently aligns with the latest Responses compatibility strategy**: official Codex OAuth preserves namespaces on function, custom-tool, generic-tool, and MCP call items, while API Key, custom-upstream, and Compact requests remove incompatible namespaces; missing, `null`, or blank instructions use the corresponding model's official base instructions; GPT-5.6 Sol / Terra / Luna use Responses Lite only when every route is official Codex, while custom or mixed providers use full Responses to retain tools such as `web.run`.

### Fixed

- **Fixed expired encrypted reasoning or compaction content terminating Codex conversations**: HTTP, streaming HTTP, Compact, and downstream WebSocket paths remove stale `encrypted_content` before any output, preserve reusable history, and retry safely once; the same error cannot loop indefinitely, and large integer request fields retain exact precision.
- **Fixed `response.failed` rate limits being reported as HTTP 400**: events whose `error.code` or `error.type` contains `rate_limit` now map to HTTP 429 so API Service can apply its existing retry or account-switch policy.
- **Fixed tool-result arrays, images, and namespace tools being lost when converting Responses to Anthropic**: text and image results become Anthropic content blocks, empty arrays receive an explicit result, top-level and `additional_tools` definitions are merged, and custom tool calls, tool-use/result pairing, plus streaming and non-streaming namespace restoration remain consistent.
- **Fixed tool-output images being dropped when converting Responses to Chat Completions**: data image URLs and nested `input_image` / `image_url` parts move into attributed user multimodal messages while preserving tool-call order, reply adjacency, and the original JSON semantics of media-free outputs.
- **Fixed Codex Team / Workspace accounts sometimes showing the personal Free subscription**: subscription parsing now matches organization ID first, then falls back through account ID, the default account, and a paid plan so multi-workspace responses select the correct record.
- **Fixed sub2api reimports showing Access Token lifetime as subscription validity**: imports now read subscription time only from `subscription_expires_at` / `subscription_active_until` and no longer treat generic account or credential `expires_at` fields as the Plus / Team subscription expiry.
- **Fixed failed Codex export conversion silently falling back to Cockpit Tools format**: when selected accounts use an unsupported type or incomplete credentials, the export dialog now shows an explicit error and keeps the selected format instead of generating a mismatched file.
- **Fixed Claude Desktop Gateway model-mapping inputs sometimes losing focus or resetting while edited**: mapping rows now use stable identities, so changing the upstream model, desktop model, or 1M-support toggle no longer causes React to rebuild the active row.
- **Fixed desktop and Start Menu shortcuts both disappearing when Windows updates from `1.3.15`**: update mode preserves existing shortcuts and repairs only the exact `1.3.15` upgrade state where both are missing; normal manual installs still remove historical product-name shortcuts without restoring a single shortcut the user intentionally deleted.

## [1.3.15] - 2026-07-29

### Added

- **Grok CLI supports third-party API Key endpoints**: when adding an account, users can choose official xAI or an OpenAI-compatible third-party endpoint and configure its Base URL, model ID, and API key; API-key accounts use an isolated `GROK_HOME`, do not overwrite the official OAuth login, and inject the key only into the corresponding CLI process.
- **CodeBuddy CN adds optional local-session sharing when switching accounts**: the switch is off by default; when enabled, account switches merge local session content and restore databases, create a local backup before changes, and do not upload session content.
- **Codex model-provider one-click test supports choosing the model first**: pick a model from selected providers’ catalogs, enter a custom model ID, or keep auto discovery instead of always testing a fixed preferred model. ([#1729](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/issues/1729))
- **Codex API Service request logs show reasoning effort and service tier**: when the request carries `reasoning.effort` / `reasoning_effort` or `service_tier`, the log list shows those values so users can verify what was actually called. ([#1690](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/issues/1690))
- **Codex can hide relay-station quota**: a setting in Settings and the Codex quick-settings popover hides mid-relay / New API style balance panels to reduce clutter; the preference is stored in user config. ([#1692](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/issues/1692))
- **Editing a Codex model provider with many API keys supports searching the existing-key list**. ([#1750](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/issues/1750))
- **WorkBuddy supports configurable auto check-in**: off by default; users can set per-account random check-in windows and log retention, and saved accounts are never checked in while the feature is disabled.
- **macOS menu bar can show live quota**: off by default; users can pick the monitored platform and optionally show an account-prefix badge.
- **MFA vault supports Google Authenticator migration QR batch import**: `otpauth-migration://` payloads can be scanned and saved into local MFA records in bulk.
- **Claude quota display can switch between used % and remaining %**: used percentage remains the default; enabling remaining % only changes presentation while auto-switch and alert thresholds still use the used ratio.

### Changed

- **ChatGPT Web Session imports now support quota viewing only**: they are no longer registered automatically as Agent Identity accounts and are not added to the Codex API Service account pool; after import, quota can still be checked, but switching, launching the official client or CLI, joining API Service, and OAuth binding are blocked.
- **Codex API Service now transparently aligns official Multi-Agent V2 requests with upstream behavior**: only Codex Desktop and `codex-tui` requests are eligible; the gateway refreshes `spawn_agent` model details, normalizes encrypted agent messages, converts them for non-Codex upstream protocols, and restores the collaboration namespace in responses without adding a user-facing workflow or setting.
- **Codex API usage now follows canonical token accounting v2**: cache reads, cache writes, uncached input, non-reasoning output, and reasoning output use mutually exclusive buckets, while contradictory or unknown upstream data is explicitly classified as `inconsistent` or `unclassified` to prevent cache and reasoning token double-counting.
- **Codex API Service account members now support explicit Highest, Normal, and Lowest usage priorities**: priority tiers apply consistently across every routing strategy and session affinity; Highest accounts are used first, Normal accounts keep the selected routing behavior, and Lowest accounts are used only when the higher tiers are unavailable. Existing backup-account settings remain compatible as Lowest priority.
- **Codex API Service routing options now expose session affinity and its expiry in the main service page**: users can enable or disable affinity and set the same 60–86,400 second TTL available from the member-management dialog.
- **Responses relay API Key projections now use the built-in OpenAI provider with `openai_base_url`**: this aligns desktop switch projections with official direct routing and avoids the local-access provider id for ordinary relays.
- **CI build-matrix and release workflows are faster**: preflight work is split into parallel jobs with improved caching and matrix scheduling.

### Fixed

- **Fixed Codex API Service average latency including failed or zero-ms transport errors**: latency averages now count successful requests only. ([#1657](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/issues/1657))
- **Fixed Windows NSIS reinstalls/updates leaving duplicate desktop shortcuts**: the installer removes known prior desktop and Start Menu shortcuts for Cockpit Tools before creating the current ones. ([#1656](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/issues/1656))
- **Fixed strict Chat Completions providers such as xAI returning HTTP 400 after Codex automatic context compaction**: Responses-to-Chat-Completions conversion now omits `tool_choice` when no effective tools are available, preventing the client from entering a reconnect loop. ([#1727](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/issues/1727))
- **Fixed ChatGPT Web Session imports failing when Agent Identity runtime registration returned HTTP 403**: this format no longer attempts runtime registration and is imported as a quota-only account.
- **Fixed Windows Desktop session working-directory normalization when paths use the `\\?\\` prefix**.
- **Fixed layout breakage when custom icon localStorage writes hit quota errors**.
- **Fixed Windows CLI quick launch opening a bare PowerShell window for the `system` terminal**: when Windows Terminal is available the launch goes through `wt`, otherwise the previous PowerShell fallback remains.
- **Fixed hardcoded Chinese fallback strings on the Codex API Service page and related controls**: missing i18n keys and default strings are filled in.
- **Fixed Codex Responses losing context or contaminating later requests after HTTP/WebSocket transport changes, upstream 1009 closes, or failed tool turns**: incremental requests remain bound to the original WebSocket and credential, unsafe continuation requires a full replay, 1009 no longer rotates credentials, and failed turns never commit to the global tool cache.
- **Fixed third-party Responses requests failing immediately when upstream explicitly rejects `input[N].namespace` or `max_output_tokens`**: only explicit 400 unknown/unsupported-parameter responses remove the rejected field and retry, retaining the upstream six-attempt limit, body-state deduplication, and tool-item type checks.
- **Fixed Codex Responses input item IDs longer than 64 characters being rejected upstream**: overlong IDs are shortened deterministically by Unicode character count with collision avoidance, while overlong reasoning items carrying encrypted content are removed according to the upstream compatibility rule.
- **Fixed Codex API Service mixed-plan account pools routing Spark requests to accounts without access**: the gateway derives per-account model exclusions from quota entitlements and filters ineligible accounts before session affinity and other routing rules; both OAuth pools and API Key pools scoped to selected accounts now send Spark requests only to accounts that support it. Thanks @kin001 ([#1759](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1759)).
- **Fixed Codex account switching resetting official `[features]` settings such as Memories**: pre-launch cleanup now preserves the complete official features table while continuing to repair only Cockpit-owned configuration formatting. Thanks @we1jia ([#1734](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1734)).
- **Fixed quota overlays not recovering when Cockpit restarts while managed Codex instances remain open**: startup now discovers the already-running default and multi-instance processes in the background, recovers their actual CDP ports, and restores profile-specific injection without blocking the main window.
- **Fixed stale API Service model catalogs remaining after switching a Codex profile back to built-in OpenAI mode**: Cockpit removes only its reserved catalog and takeover backup while preserving arbitrary user catalogs, so later account switches or API Key catalog synchronization no longer reuse stale models. Thanks @kin001 ([#1718](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1718)).
- **Fixed New API accounts showing no quota when the provider returns token-allocation or billing-only fields**: account, dashboard, and provider views now share normalized `quotaLimit`, `quotaRemaining`, and `accessUntil` fallbacks. Thanks @kin001 ([#1712](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1712)).
- **Fixed Codex startup or session-visibility repair failing on binary or invalid UTF-8 rollout files**: repair now handles only plain `rollout-*.jsonl` files and skips unreadable entries with diagnostics instead of cancelling startup. Thanks @kin001 ([#1710](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1710)).
- **Fixed xAI image generation and editing requests being omitted from usage statistics**: successful requests, upstream failures, rate limits, and request-construction failures now publish usage events with the actual requested model. Thanks @Ac-spider ([#1629](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1629)).
- **Fixed fast Codex batch imports sometimes remaining indefinitely in the preparing state**: when scanning completes before the frontend receives the session ID, the persisted terminal preview is reconciled immediately without changing the import protocol or credential format. Thanks @HUF457 ([#1716](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1716)).

## [1.3.14] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- **Web Sessions can be registered automatically as Agent Identity accounts**: confirmed imports are added to the Codex API Service account pool automatically and can be exported and imported across devices; these accounts are limited to API Service use and do not support normal account switching, client or CLI launch, or OAuth binding.

### Fixed

- **Fixed custom Responses API Key accounts with “Sync model catalog to Codex” enabled being rejected by Codex API Service**: model-catalog synchronization continues to affect only direct account switching and instance-specific gateways, no longer changes API Service pool eligibility, and keeps Chat Completions accounts isolated behind instance-specific gateways.

## [1.3.13] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- **Fixed Codex official direct wakeup failing for K12 Agent Identity accounts**: wakeup requests now generate `AgentAssertion` credentials dynamically, register and persist a missing or invalid task, and retry safely once while preserving the existing wakeup behavior for regular OAuth accounts.

## [1.3.12] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- **Fixed Agent Identity users in the same K12 workspace overwriting each other**: accounts are now distinguished by the combined ChatGPT account and user identity; reimporting the same user still updates the existing account and preserves its saved metadata, while accounts saved by the previous release keep their existing identifier.

## [1.3.11] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- **Codex accounts and API Service support the new Agent Identity authentication flow**: users can import Agent Identity accounts from official `auth.json`, JSON/JSONL, and Sub2API backups, including Sub2API's PKCS#8 v1 Ed25519 keys, keep Team workspaces separated by ChatGPT account, and switch them into official Codex; quota, rate-limit reset, HTTP, streaming Responses, Compact, image, and WebSocket requests dynamically generate `AgentAssertion` credentials, while missing or invalid tasks are registered, persisted, and recovered automatically without changing existing OAuth, Access Token, PAT, or API Key accounts.
- **Codex API Service quota overlay now supports manual refresh and account-pool health details in the ChatGPT client**: a compact refresh action beside the account and quota badges refreshes the API Service account pool, shows an in-place spinner while refreshing, and updates the displayed account count, 5-hour quota, weekly quota, available/abnormal/cooldown counts, and plan groups when complete; an empty account pool is shown immediately as zero accounts and zero quota.
- **Codex CLI launch dialogs support fast previews and launch options**: the account and instance pages can remember a recent working directory, choose Terminal.app, iTerm2, PowerShell, pwsh, Windows Terminal, or cmd, and quickly generate the corresponding command; the instance runtime is prepared only when the user copies the command or runs it in a terminal, while stale or broken CLI paths are skipped so another working CLI can be selected, including Codex bundled with the official client.
- **CodeBuddy and WorkBuddy add a “Share Local Sessions on Switch” setting**: it is off by default; when enabled, account switches merge sessions and restore state in the real local session directories and databases, create local backups before changes, and do not upload session content.

### Changed

- **Codex API Service supports configurable session affinity and expiry**: users can set a session-affinity TTL from 60 to 86,400 seconds, keeping account binding for a session key during that period.
- **Codex API Service gateway preparation and account refresh are now observable background flows**: the UI reports preparation and account-refresh progress, while OAuth credential refresh runs after the gateway is available instead of blocking startup on the entire account pool.
- **Custom Codex Responses model catalogs support official display-model mapping**: synchronized catalogs use recognizable official display names in the Codex client while requests remain routed to the configured upstream models.

### Fixed

- **Fixed an occasional PowerShell `0xc0000142` dialog during Windows restart**: Cockpit Tools now observes the system shutdown notification early, pauses background injection, and blocks new PowerShell or other background child processes before Windows ends the session; normal operation resumes if shutdown is cancelled, without changing the app auto-launch setting.
- **Fixed multi-instance pages flashing back to a loading state after re-entry or actions**: instance lists now keep already loaded or locally cached data visible while refreshing in the background, then replace it silently; the loading state appears only when no displayable data exists on the first load.
- **Disabling Codex API Service now restores managed Codex profile files**: Cockpit Tools removes only the API Service fields it owns from `config.toml`, restores the pre-takeover `auth.json`, deletes injected profile artifacts and model cache, preserves unrelated user settings and other gateway backups, and no longer silently re-enables a disabled service when starting an instance that remains bound to it.

---
## [1.3.10] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- **Codex API Service can show account count and quotas in the ChatGPT client**: the feature is enabled by default; after restarting the corresponding Codex instance, the API Service account count together with 5-hour and weekly quota appears below the composer and follows window and composer layout changes. Users who do not need the feature or encounter display issues can turn it off in Settings.
- **Codex Token / JSON input shows per-account progress for bulk imports**: JSON arrays, Sub2API account arrays, newline-delimited JSON, and token lines are imported sequentially while the status area and import button show real progress such as `1/10` and `2/10`; single-account objects remain intact, and partial failures preserve successful imports while reporting the failed count and reasons.

### Changed

- **Codex account deletion now provides fast, immediate feedback**: an account disappears from the UI as soon as it is removed from local persistent storage, while API Service pool cleanup and gateway synchronization continue in the background instead of blocking the delete action.

### Fixed

- **Fixed Codex accounts remaining temporarily visible after Windows batch deletion**: the account list now reconciles with the local account store as batch progress advances and when a job is paused, completed, or manually cleared; deleting every account is allowed to synchronize an empty list, and deletion events refresh the floating card window, so a failed switch is no longer required before stale accounts disappear.
- **Fixed the Add Note button in the Codex authorization dialog losing its project styling**: note actions rendered inside the portal now use the same pill-button styling as the accounts page instead of falling back to the browser-native button appearance.

---
## [1.3.9] - 2026-07-17

### Changed

- **Trae CN / TRAE SOLO CN quota and plan logic aligned with official v2 and community work (#1281)**: CN account refresh prefers pay v2 (`ide_user_pay_status` / `ide_user_ent_usage`) and falls back with `user_current_entitlement_list`; recognizes CN product types such as `CNExpress(100)` and `Pro+ Pack(5)`; shows fast-request remaining counts and Solo pack concurrency, uses “synced, remaining pending” when data exists but remaining quota cannot be derived, and avoids guessing free remaining; the CN add-account flow documents full JSON only (no raw token). Thanks @sqmw ([#1281](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1281)).

### Fixed

- **Fixed Windows current-user NSIS updates unexpectedly requesting administrator privileges (#1642)**: when Tauri cannot identify the installer bundle type, the updater now selects NSIS for writable user-level installations and keeps the conservative MSI fallback for protected directories; explicit NSIS/MSI metadata remains authoritative, so genuine system-level MSI installations keep their existing update behavior. Thanks @xdd666t ([#1642](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/pull/1642)).
- **Fixed Codex Responses Lite dropping namespaced collaboration tools (#1647)**: namespace tool definitions are now preserved across top-level `tools`, nested `input[].additional_tools`, payload overrides, and namespace `tool_choice`; derived GPT sessions can again use `spawn_agent`, `wait_agent`, `send_message`, `followup_task`, `interrupt_agent`, and `list_agents`, while Sol / Terra / Luna shorthand in spawn requests is normalized to the exact GPT-5.6 model IDs. ([#1647](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/issues/1647))
- **Fixed expired or stale Codex accounts sometimes remaining visible after deletion (#1646)**: removing an account no longer waits for API Service gateway restart or fails solely because pool reconciliation is unavailable; pool references are persisted first, gateway reconciliation continues in the background, and local deletion proceeds so the account disappears immediately without requiring another valid account to be added. ([#1646](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/issues/1646))
- **Fixed HTTP 200 Responses streams treating upstream overloads as non-retryable `400` errors (#1651)**: `server_is_overloaded` / `service_unavailable_error` now trigger short credential cooldown and safe account failover before any output is sent, while `model_at_capacity` is treated as a retryable capacity limit; terminal Responses errors preserve a valid `response.failed` SSE event so Codex reports the real upstream failure instead of a generic disconnected stream. ([#1651](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/issues/1651))

---
## [1.3.8] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- **Existing Codex accounts can be added directly to Codex API Service (#1628)**: eligible accounts already imported into Cockpit can now be added from the card, list, or table view without leaving the current page; the action reuses the incremental account-pool flow and keeps the existing restrictions for Free accounts, pending authorization, and incompatible API keys. Thanks @Ac-spider.
- **Kiro supports AWS IAM Identity Center sign-in**: the add-account dialog now supports AWS Builder ID and Enterprise device authorization; Enterprise sign-in accepts an AWS Region and IAM Identity Center Start URL, while successful accounts preserve their client-registration context and write the official AWS SSO cache files so token refresh and real Kiro account switching continue to work.

### Fixed

- **Fixed Codex conversations stopping when image tool results reached text-only third-party models**: Provider Gateway now advertises image input according to each model's actual capabilities; when the selected model has neither image support nor a valid vision route, `view_image` results and historical images are replaced with an explicit omission notice and the conversation continues on the current model, while configured vision routes still switch automatically and remain preserved across app restarts.
- **Fixed managed Codex instances on macOS sometimes being reported as started before their GUI was ready**: instances now launch through LaunchServices with `open -n -a`, while `CODEX_HOME`, `CODEX_ELECTRON_USER_DATA_PATH`, and the isolated `--user-data-dir` are preserved; Cockpit resolves the real ChatGPT process PID and no longer stores the temporary `open` launcher PID or zombie processes.
- **Fixed macOS Codex launches remaining pinned to the legacy `/Applications/Codex.app` after the official client moved to `/Applications/ChatGPT.app`**: exact legacy official paths are migrated through the guarded config update before the app root is resolved, while custom locations and systems without the ChatGPT app remain unchanged. (#1631) Thanks @jackychanisnotme.
- **Fixed Responses streams emitting incomplete or concatenated JSON events**: transport fragments are buffered until they form a complete event, while narrowly valid concatenated event documents are separated into independent SSE frames, preventing client parse failures and lost follow-up events. (#1632) Thanks @Ac-spider.
- **Fixed long Responses conversations failing with `Item with id not found` while history storage is disabled**: orphan reasoning IDs without usable encrypted content are removed before replay, valid reasoning signatures and explicit `store=true` requests remain unchanged, and large histories are rebuilt in one pass. (#1634) Thanks @Ac-spider.
- **Fixed compatible Chat Completions providers omitting tool-call IDs and breaking Codex tool execution**: deterministic fallback IDs are preserved across streaming and non-streaming Responses events without replacing IDs supplied by conforming providers. (#1633) Thanks @Ac-spider.
- **Fixed image-only `gpt-image-*` models being dispatched through Chat Completions**: invalid requests now return a clear `400` before occupying account-pool concurrency, while Responses and dedicated image endpoints keep their existing behavior. (#1630) Thanks @Ac-spider.

---
## [1.3.7] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- **Codex API Service is now a first-class platform entry**: it has its own navigation identity and page entry, with collection members and operations moved out of the regular Codex accounts page; existing platform layouts attach it to the Codex group once, while the dashboard, floating card, and data transfer treat it as an accountless service page; the page shows whether it is current and provides an explicit action to enable the service and switch the default Codex instance.
- **Codex API Service client catalog includes GPT-5.6 Sol / Terra / Luna**: official model metadata covers context windows, search-tool capability, and reasoning efforts through `max` / `ultra` (where the model supports them), with Responses Lite routing for these models.
- **Codex API Key provider changes synchronize linked account snapshots**: editing a managed model provider updates the linked API Key accounts' endpoint, wire protocol, model catalog, vision capabilities, and WebSocket support while preserving account usage metadata.
- **Codex API Service can add accounts without leaving the current page**: the existing Codex OAuth, Token / JSON, API Key, and local-import flows open in place; new accounts can join the API Service automatically, empty collections offer direct add/manage actions, nested import and account-note dialogs remain usable, and operation feedback can be dismissed independently.

### Changed

- **Codex pages preserve loaded state while switching**: the Codex account page and API Service page remain mounted after first use, so switching between them keeps existing data visible while refreshes run in the background.
- **Main window size and position memory is now opt-in and off by default**: window state is saved and restored across restart or tray rebuild only after users enable it under Settings → General, so existing users are not affected by position restoration by default.
- **Codex client catalog advertises search tools only for official template models on Codex credentials**: synthesized or non-Codex-routed models no longer claim `supports_search_tool`, reducing broken tool-search attempts on incompatible routes.
- **Codex API Service Ollama-compatible model metadata recognizes GPT-5.6 and deeper reasoning efforts**: family/context mapping covers `gpt-5.6*`, and thinking efforts accept `max` / `ultra` in addition to `low` / `medium` / `high` / `xhigh`.
- **Codex API Service Responses WebSocket is now an account-pool routing toggle**: it is off by default for new and existing configurations; only OAuth API Service profiles and their multi-instance profiles use WebSocket after users enable it under Account Pool → Routing Options, while third-party ProviderGateway profiles remain disabled.

### Fixed

- **Fixed Codex client catalog overwriting template context limits**: the API Service no longer forces a hard-coded `max_context_window` of `1000000` on every model; official template values (including GPT-5.6) are preserved, and defaults fill only missing fields on synthesized models.
- **Fixed Codex Desktop Responses Lite sessions that send `tools: null` and lose tool definitions**: tool definitions carried in `additional_tools` input items are merged into the upstream request, custom tool history is replayed, and freeform tool outputs with content-part arrays are flattened so the model still sees available tools and prior tool results.
- **Fixed Codex account deletion removing the local file before API Service pool cleanup completed**: deletion now removes the account from the API Service pool through the same path as manual removal before deleting local credentials, preventing a false deletion failure followed by an empty JSON export.
- **Fixed new Codex conversations on Chat Completions providers briefly failing with `auth_unavailable` before recovering**: WebSocket support for Chat Completions is now always normalized to `false` when provider settings are loaded, created, or updated, and its editor no longer shows the WebSocket toggle; provider-gateway profile takeover explicitly writes `supports_websockets = false` regardless of the previous profile value; the Sidecar also prevents provider-gateway requests from entering the Codex WebSocket auth route.
- **Fixed Codex multi-instance shared-directory creation failing under standard Windows permissions or cross-drive paths**: shared directories now use an in-process native NTFS junction API instead of PowerShell or `mklink`; if junction creation is unavailable, Cockpit safely falls back to copying the directory and refuses to overwrite a non-empty target.
- **Fixed the main window briefly appearing and then moving off-screen during position restore**: minimized-window coordinates are no longer saved, and restored positions must overlap a current display or they are cleared and the window is centered.
- **Fixed managed Codex instances from the Windows Store being able to open the default account by mistake**: when `CODEX_HOME` and the instance data directory cannot be passed reliably, Cockpit no longer falls back to Store AppUserModelID activation or an arbitrary default Codex process; launch is blocked with guidance to switch that instance to CLI mode.
- **Fixed pending or incomplete OAuth accounts being able to enter the Codex API Service**: these accounts remain visible with an explanation in the member picker but cannot be selected until authorization completes; the backend pool applies the same eligibility rule so accounts that cannot serve API traffic are not persisted.
- **Fixed Codex batch deletion remaining stuck at `0/N` after accounts were removed**: the job now removes the selected accounts from the API Service pool once before deleting local account files, bounds that cleanup to five seconds as best effort, and the account page polls until the job pauses, completes, or fails before refreshing and clearing successful jobs.
- **Fixed Codex API Key provider WebSocket changes not propagating to existing linked accounts**: saving a managed provider now updates the linked API Key account snapshots and rewrites the current `config.toml` when applicable, so later normal account switches keep `supports_websockets = true` for eligible custom Responses providers; Chat Completions and built-in OpenAI remain disabled.
- **Fixed Codex sidecar streaming bootstrap retries reading the legacy single-account retry setting**: the new API Service now uses its dedicated streaming bootstrap retry value. (#1572, PR #1617) Thanks @kin001.
- **Fixed Kiro IAM Identity Center refresh failing after the imported token expired**: `clientIdHash` now resolves the exact AWS SSO client registration file so the stored client ID and secret can be reused. (#1300, PR #1614) Thanks @kin001.
- **Fixed Wakeup omitting available models that were missing from upstream sort metadata**: valid map-only models are now retained with deterministic fallback ordering. (#1313, PR #1613) Thanks @kin001.
- **Fixed Claude Desktop quota refresh remaining blocked after a Cloudflare challenge**: failed direct requests can fall back to a cooldown-protected Electron page-context probe, with the original diagnostics preserved if the probe fails. (#1337, PR #1612) Thanks @kin001.
- **Fixed Grok account listings being able to surface a known persisted test fixture**: only the complete fixture fingerprint is cleaned, so real accounts are not matched by email alone.

---
## [1.3.6] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- **Main window UI zoom shortcuts (#1601)**: on macOS use ⌘+/⌘- to zoom and ⌘0 to reset to 100%; on Windows/Linux use Ctrl combinations; steps match Settings → General → UI Scale (90%–150%), persist to `ui_scale`, and survive restarts.
- **Codex API Service stats show cached tokens**: usage cards display cached token counts alongside input/output. Thanks @JesmonX for #1593.
- **Codex API Service concurrent image distribution and per-account image limits**: in-flight image generation/edit jobs default to one per account, prefer idle accounts and queue locally; image requests can bypass session affinity; Settings allow 1–16 concurrent image jobs per account. Thanks @phatchau036 for #1578.
- **Provider presets include MiniMax M3 / M2.7**: Codex and Claude-related presets expose MiniMax-M3 and MiniMax-M2.7 and update docs links. Thanks @octo-patch for #1558.

### Changed

- **Reverted the 1.3.1 multi-task Codex batch-import queue (#1286) and restored the 1.3.0 import dialog flow**: importing local JSON still opens a single-session batch-import modal instead of multi-task queuing or the bottom-right global task strip; “check accounts before import” stays off by default, can be turned on for live list progress, and you select accounts after parse/check finishes; cancel, resume, and minimize with view/dismiss on the accounts page remain available.
- **Codex session visibility repair runs in the backend for the selected instance before launch**: after switching OAuth / API / API Service, Cockpit no longer relies on a frontend repair progress dialog and reconciles on the next launch of that instance. Thanks @deanjo for #1563.
- **Codex API Service App Speed payload hot-reloads without restarting the sidecar**: active streams are not interrupted; request logs gain a `service_tier` column with migration for existing databases. Thanks @kin001 for #1587.
- **Quota pools show real usage windows**: primary windows are no longer always labeled `5h`; aggregation follows the windows reported on each account. Thanks @kin001 for #1587.
- **Floating card platform dropdown only lists platforms enabled under Platform Layout → Show in menu bar**, keeping layout order. Thanks @happyplum for #1596.
- **Windows NSIS install mode is current-user only (`currentUser`)**: the app installs under the user local AppData tree so install and auto-update no longer request administrator rights by default, which helps managed/school/enterprise accounts. Thanks @xdd666t for #1602.

### Fixed

- **Fixed Windows close-to-tray destroying the main WebView so floating-card reopen only worked once**: after tray destroy, residual `main` handles are cleared and the window is rebuilt on the UI thread, navigation is deferred until remount, and the main HWND is focused correctly. Thanks @happyplum for #1595.
- **Fixed tray Quit not actually exiting after the main window was destroyed to tray**: mark an explicit user exit before quit so `ExitRequested` no longer keeps the process alive for tray-only mode. See #1595 / #1600.
- **Fixed Codex multi-instance create/copy not applying the selected bound account**: after the profile is initialized and before create returns, credentials are written for `bind_account_id` so the new instance does not keep the source account. Thanks @kin001 for #1604 / #1599.
- **Fixed reused API keys getting duplicated when switching managed providers**: add/edit flows carry the previous provider identity and move the shared key to the newly selected provider while preserving saved labels and timestamps when possible. Thanks @kin001 for #1605 / #1597.
- **Fixed Grok CLI OAuth accounts looking expired too easily when the official CLI and Cockpit both refresh tokens**: before quota refresh or launch injection, Cockpit now picks the newest **same-account** credentials from the account store, the managed profile `auth.json`, and official `~/.grok/auth.json` (matched by principal / user id / email), prefers a still-valid access token without racing a refresh, and only falls back to refresh or re-auth when nothing usable remains.
- **Fixed local sidecar build failure after the concurrent-image merge**: session affinity and image-request selectors are combined correctly so Go no longer fails on an unused `affinitySelector`.
- **Fixed global tag delete in the account tag editor using only a browser `confirm` and being easy to mis-click**: deleting a suggested “existing tag” now opens an in-app confirm dialog (no overlay dismiss) and only then removes the tag from all accounts. See #645.
- **Fixed Codex account cards collapsing tags too early**: up to eight tags are shown with wrapping before `+N`, so three short tags are no longer forced into a collapsed chip. See #962.
- **Fixed account timestamps that used 12-hour clocks on some locales and made AM/PM hard to read**: list/create times use a fixed 24-hour format. See #859.
- **Fixed mixed monospace/system fonts on Codex cards, error text, OTP/mail previews, and session IDs**: UI text sticks to the design-system sans font; mono only where codes need it. See #1089.
- **Fixed the top error banner still showing after an account was deleted**: successful deletes clear the page-level error message on Antigravity, Codex, and shared provider account pages. See #1160.
- **Fixed Codex batch-import sticky task bars that could not be cleared after a failed or empty import**: the bar always offers dismiss; running jobs can cancel and dismiss; restoring a session with no selectable accounts clears the leftover task automatically. See #1445.
- **Fixed the Codex model-provider page with no gap between the select-all row and the provider cards**: selection bar and card grid spacing are restored. See #1164.
- **Confirmed add-account and other dialogs only close via explicit close/cancel actions, not by clicking the dimmed overlay**, matching the project modal rule and the #999 report.
- **Codex overview filters gain 0% quota and expired subscription options, and clarify the auth-failure filter label**: multi-select can isolate exhausted OAuth quotas or expired subscriptions alongside existing plan/valid/error filters. See #1156 / #681.
- **Codex can export all auth-failed accounts in one action** from the overview selection bar (JSON export modal). See #992.
- **Codex batch import supports optional bulk tags**: enter comma/space-separated tags before import; they are applied to successfully imported accounts. See #1166.
- **Fixed Codex custom sort mode resetting after switching tabs**: when the custom-sort flag is active, sort mode restores to custom on remount instead of a stale saved sort field. See #1123.
- **Fixed Antigravity list/card layout forgetting after leaving the page**: view mode always persists, independent of the “remember filters” switch. See #1200.
- **Portuguese (Brazil) locale keeps full key coverage with native strings** for the new filter/export/import UX keys (and existing parity checks). See #860.
- **Main window size and position are remembered across restarts and tray reopen**: resize/move are saved; close-to-tray destroy and full quit also snapshot geometry; the next launch and tray recreate restore width/height (and position when available), respecting the existing min size. See #948 / #1132.

---
## [1.3.5] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- **Codex API Service proxies Responses Lite web search**: the local gateway adds `/v1/alpha/search` (plus a direct-compatible path), schedules an OAuth account, and forwards to ChatGPT Codex alpha search so Lite web.run search works again.
- **Codex API Service supports Responses WebSocket**: the gateway exposes a `GET /v1/responses` upgrade route; local API Service profiles advertise WebSocket support so the client can use WS instead of always falling back to SSE.
- **Grok CLI supports full account export and re-import**: export keeps credentials for recovery; add-account tabs match Codex (OAuth · Token / JSON · API Key · Local import) so you can paste official `auth.json` or Cockpit export JSON, or pick a JSON file.
- **Codex quota error cards show a short summary with a details modal**: cards keep a compact summary (including HTTP status summaries); full error bodies (including HTML/body dumps) open via View Details so long failures no longer blow up the list layout.

### Fixed

- **Fixed model pricing settings that could not be saved**: non-long-context models (such as `gpt-5.4-mini`) may leave the long-context token threshold empty; save is blocked only when the value is invalid, or long-context price tiers are set without a valid threshold. Thanks @andrew05060414 for #1592.
- **Fixed WorkBuddy daily check-in status not matching the official client**: status queries prefer the official Buddy fuel-station endpoint `checkin-activity-status` (with fallback to `checkin-status`); the UI state machine matches the official available / claimed / inactive flow; accounts with `today_checked_in` show as Claimed, and a successful claim updates local state first then refreshes in the background so success no longer stays Not Checked In or Unavailable.
- **Fixed deleting a Grok account that was bound to an instance**: delete now clears default/multi-instance bindings automatically, so you no longer need to unbind first.
- **Fixed legacy “disable image generation” settings that left image gen clickable while the gateway hid `gpt-image-2`**: collection-level `Disabled` / `ImagesOnly` now migrate to `Enabled`, matching the 1.3.4 removal of the disable UI.
- **Fixed OAuth-backed local API Responses Lite requests that incorrectly injected hosted tools and failed or broke image generation**: HTTP, SSE, and WebSocket paths filter unsupported hosted tools while keeping client-executed tools. Thanks @kin001 for #1577.
- **Fixed WorkBuddy multi-instance data directories not matching the official layout**: defaults resolve and create the official `~/.workbuddy` config root and `~/.workbuddy/app` Electron userData layout, and start instances with the correct `WORKBUDDY_CONFIG_DIR` / `WORKBUDDY_USER_DATA_DIR`.
- **Fixed Windows app paths showing the `\\?\` extended prefix**: load, detect, save, and Settings display now strip `\\?\` / `\\?\UNC\` so users see normal drive-letter or UNC paths.

---
## [1.3.4] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- **Codex API Service Client Keys support per-key account routing and model policy**: each key can inherit the service account pool or use a custom ordered pool with a pinned priority account; keys can restrict allowed/excluded models and model prefixes; OAuth-bound and provider-gateway keys keep a fixed account scope instead of inheriting or clearing it; the sidecar enforces the selected pool and isolates session affinity per client key. Thanks @kin001 for #1470.
- **Client Keys show per-key usage for today, this week, and this month**: each key surfaces request count, compact token totals, success rate, and estimated cost using local calendar boundaries (local midnight, Monday, and the first day of the month). Thanks @kin001 for #1470.
- **Codex API Service supports random account routing**: new requests can distribute across eligible accounts while preserving session affinity, cooldown, account health, quota reserve, and model eligibility rules.
- **Optional immediate SSE 200 responses for the sidecar gateway**: commits `200 OK` and an `: accepted` SSE comment before the upstream stream opens; disabled by default, with upstream failures reported as SSE errors after headers are committed.
- **Codex API Service request logs can show and filter by multi-instance source**: instances bound to the local API service record a source marker; the log list displays the instance name, and the filter is a dropdown of instance names (no need to remember directory IDs).

### Changed

- **Removed the `image_generation` disable feature**: the previous request filtering and OAuth local-gateway workaround for providers returning `Image generation is not enabled` are no longer used; image generation remains available through the normal Codex API path.
- **Devin/Windsurf no longer participates in background token keepalive**: Cockpit will not automatically refresh and write back the local login without an explicit user action, avoiding background macOS Keychain prompts; manual account switching and bound-instance startup still inject credentials when requested.

### Fixed

- **Fixed Grok CLI still showing a “current” badge when “sync official login on switch” is off**: with the switch off, account switches no longer track a global current account and the overview no longer shows the current badge; with it on, official login sync and the current badge still work as before.
- **Fixed OAuth-backed Codex API Service requests failing or losing image tools on Responses Lite models**: regular Lite requests now filter unsupported hosted tools, while image-generation requests automatically use full Responses and preserve hosted `image_generation`, `image_gen.imagegen`, and `image_gen` namespace tools; pure API-key service behavior remains unchanged.
- **Fixed GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark missing from model selection and profile catalogs**: Spark now appears in the model selector and generated Codex profile catalogs, with quota progress available when the account reports it. Thanks @kin001 for #1470.
- **Fixed OAuth binding conflicting with Codex API Service image-generation settings and inconsistent local/third-party projection**: OAuth-bound profiles use `requires_openai_auth = true` so the OAuth login remains active; local loopback API Service always allows image-generation projection; third-party providers only write actor and related headers when the model catalog explicitly includes `gpt-image-2`, and clear stale actor headers when it does not, so the client does not open image gen and hang on Confirming; multi-instance profiles and takeover checks follow the same rules.
- **Fixed the “copy source instance” dropdown failing to open or closing immediately when creating multi-instance profiles**: the control now uses a stable portal-mounted select so parent re-renders no longer tear down the open menu.
- **Fixed Codex accounts failing to batch-import or batch-delete under special Windows mount paths**: batch operations are no longer blocked when their task snapshot directory cannot be created, and existing directories are no longer recreated.
- **Fixed Codex wakeup tasks still listing accounts after they were deleted**: deleting accounts now prunes matching `account_ids` from wakeup tasks; load / save / run also drop missing accounts; tasks with no remaining accounts are removed; cards, edit drafts, and test lists only show accounts that still exist.

---
## [1.3.2] - 2026-07-15

### Highlights

- **Fixed Codex API Service accounts not appearing and account additions hanging after an upgrade**: pricing and statistics migrations now run in background batches so accounts and existing statistics appear first; maintenance is single-flight and merges safely instead of overwriting newer configuration with a stale snapshot.
- **Fixed disabling `image_generation` not taking effect for OAuth-bound accounts**
- **Windows app-path detection now checks running processes**: app discovery no longer performs broad disk scans, and detection tasks have bounded timeouts with clearer guidance to start the target app first.

### Added

- **Grok CLI can optionally sync the official login on account switch**: the setting defaults off and keeps using a separate `GROK_HOME`; when enabled, OAuth switches for the default instance update the official `~/.grok/auth.json`. API keys launch through `XAI_API_KEY`, while additional instances always stay isolated.

### Changed

- **Startup and account-maintenance work now runs without blocking the UI**: wakeup restoration, Deep Link initialization, account-encryption migration, local-account auto-import, and background token-keeper scans no longer block the main window or account reads; slow work has timeouts, deduplication, and failure fallback.
- **Account-detail migrations now use safe background rewrites**: upgrades return usable accounts before rewriting legacy encryption or formats; if an account is updated or deleted meanwhile, the stale migration result is discarded instead of restoring old data.

### Fixed

- **Fixed Codex session-type filtering being inconsistent with bulk actions**: visible groups, selected sessions, and stale selections now follow the active conversation / external / subagent filter.
- **Fixed older asynchronous account requests overwriting newer add, delete, or switch results**: account lists and current-account state now accept only the latest response, avoiding regressions to an empty list or stale account.
- **Fixed deactivated Codex workspaces still appearing healthy**: `deactivated_workspace` now surfaces as an abnormal account state.

---
## [1.3.1] - 2026-07-14

### Highlights

- **Codex API image generation compatibility restored**: third-party API Service and API Key providers can use built-in Codex image generation again; providers exposing `gpt-image-2` and managed instances now receive the required configuration.
- **Codex account sync over SSH**: manage hosts, test connections, sync `auth.json` / `config.toml`, verify remote hashes, sync after account switches, and reload the remote Codex app-server/daemon when possible.
- **Optional Hermes auth sync on Codex switch**: OAuth account switches can update `~/.hermes/auth.json`; API Key accounts are skipped and sync failures do not block switching.

### Added

- **Settings can auto-import local client accounts**: turning the switch on immediately scans official-client logins and imports current accounts, then keeps importing when those clients switch accounts; the scan can be turned off anytime, and the system keychain may prompt once.
- **Codex API Service tiered pricing, long-context thresholds, and historical cost recalculation**: the default price book covers current Codex models (including GPT-5.6 Sol / Terra / Luna); costs resolve across Standard / Standard (long context) / Priority bands with Flex support; long-context thresholds and rates are configurable; saving or upgrading defaults can recalculate historical estimates.
- **Global “Reduce motion” setting**: tones down page fades, modal transitions, shadows/blur, and smooth scrolling while keeping essential loading feedback.
- **“Add to API Service” members support backup marks and a routing shortcut**: toggle backup on each member row and switch routing strategy next to Free-account restrict; custom routing still owns priority/weight, and backup applies under every routing strategy.
- **Codex can import personal access tokens (`at-*`) for API Service / sidecar**: import common JSON exports or line-based token lists; access-token accounts write sidecar auth metadata for reverse-proxy and local-access use.
- **Codex Token / JSON import accepts personal access tokens (`at-…` / `personal_access_token`)**: paste a single `at-…` line, JSON with that field, or `auth.json`; without refresh/id, auth is stored in the official `personal_access_token` shape (no separate add-account tab). Thanks @daodeqing for the idea and scenario reference in #1448.
- **Settings → General can set a startup page**: choose a fixed page on cold start, or “Remember last” to restore the previous page (default).
- **Optional Hermes auth sync on Codex switch**: when enabled in Settings, OAuth account switches write `openai-codex` credentials into `~/.hermes/auth.json` (`providers` + `credential_pool`); API-key accounts are skipped and failures do not block the switch. Thanks @iwillwill-ALLWILL for the idea and scenario reference in #1434.
- **Theme color packs (Nord / Tokyo Night / Catppuccin / Gruvbox / Everforest)**: Settings → General can layer a color pack on light/dark. Thanks @letr1n1ty for the idea and scenario reference in #1399.
- **External network kill switch + WebDAV domain allowlist**: when off, blocks WebDAV sync, remote announcements, and auto update checks, and can restrict WebDAV hosts. Thanks @YSheldon for the idea and scenario reference in #1104.
- **Account detail encryption at rest (AES-256-GCM)**: Antigravity account tokens and provider account detail files are stored in local envelopes with automatic plaintext migration/rotation; index/summary files stay plaintext. Thanks @YSheldon for the idea and scenario reference in #1104.
- **WebSocket session auth for high-risk account ops**: token export, account add, and account delete over the local WebSocket require the per-process auth token published in `server.json`. Thanks @YSheldon for the idea and scenario reference in #1104.
- **Codex SSH account sync**: SSH tab manages hosts, tests connection, syncs `auth.json`/`config.toml` with remote hash verification, auto-syncs after switch, and reloads the remote Codex app-server/daemon when possible. Thanks @enyihou for the idea and scenario reference in #1404.
- **Codex plan badge can use style-only variants (outline / soft / mono)**: quick settings pick a chrome style while the plan text stays the raw plan value. Thanks @vs2pk0 for the idea and scenario reference in #772.
- **Codex sessions classify as conversation / external / subagent** with a session-manager type filter (defaults to conversations); open rollout files with the OS app, multi-instance same-ID sessions require picking an instance, and total-only token stats display correctly. Thanks @andrew05060414 for the idea and scenario reference in #1510.
- **Unified Codex batch-import task queue**: one or many JSON files open the same dialog, with a choice between pre-import account checks and direct import without checks; parsing, checking, and account writes can all continue in the background with phase-specific progress, and completed scans prompt for review; the bottom-right stack shows up to three jobs and can expand to the full queue; cancelling an import stops remaining accounts while preserving completed results. Thanks @kerryNie-user for the idea and scenario reference in #1286.
- **Codex model-provider API keys can be renamed explicitly**: reusing the same key no longer overwrites a saved display name.
- **CodeBuddy local session file manager**: account page can scan and open local session-related file locations. Thanks @eye-gu for the idea and scenario reference in #1188.
- **CodeBuddy local session file listing (first slice)**: best-effort scan of common CodeBuddy data paths for session-like JSON/JSONL files. Thanks @eye-gu for the idea and scenario reference in #1188.
- **Managed local LB provider id `cockpit-codex-lb`** is exposed for wiring local API as a stable provider name. Thanks @Enjoyoer for the idea and scenario reference in #980.

### Changed

- **Removed the Gemini CLI account-management platform**: navigation, account/instance pages, tray, floating card, auto-refresh, import/export, and related local settings are gone; Antigravity Gemini model quota rows are unchanged.
- **Codex default model prices and local billing rules were upgraded**: upgrades re-seed local prices (clear prior overrides and bump the price-book version) and recalculate historical estimates; long-context cached rates match the public book.
- **“Add to API Service” member order matches the account overview**: the dialog no longer has its own sort controls—overview order is the member-list order.
- **Grok account and floating cards show fuller remaining quota**: weekly and product remaining percentages, with compact plan aliases mapped for display.
- **Floating card follows the main-window platform focus**: e.g. Grok when the main window is on Grok, with the selection remembered across windows instead of staying locked on Antigravity.
- **Tray minimize can destroy the main WebView to free memory**: close-to-tray destroys the main WebView while tray/backend keep running; reopening from tray recreates the window (falls back to hide on failure). Thanks @F0RLE for the idea and scenario reference in #686.
- **Codex account cards use denser padding/action spacing** for overview grids. Thanks @amoorkie for the idea and scenario reference in #1287.

### Fixed

- **Fixed Codex built-in image generation for third-party API Service and API Key providers**: capable providers that expose `gpt-image-2` now write the required auth gate and actor header, and registered multi-instance profiles receive the same configuration independently.
- **Fixed Codex model-provider batch tests that could not be exited while running**: the dialog can now be closed or the task cancelled at any time; cancellation stops remaining provider tests, interrupts the active request, and cleans up the temporary provider gateway.
- **Fixed “Show model-specific quota” not restoring GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark rows**: Spark additional rate limits are no longer dropped in the parser, so the quick-settings switch can show or hide them like other `additional:*` windows. Thanks for the idea and scenario reference in #1540.
- **Fixed Codex token re-import for the active account leaving the running client on the old credential**: when the imported account is already current, Cockpit re-activates it so auth.json / local projection picks up the new token without a manual switch. Thanks @lishunsheng-dev for the idea and scenario reference in #1325.
- **Fixed Windows API Service bind errors that did not mention reserved/excluded ports**: AddrInUse messages check `netsh` excluded TCP ranges and hint to change the port or inspect Hyper-V/WSL reservations. Thanks @tanzui for the idea and scenario reference in #1297.
- **Fixed Windows Antigravity data-dir detection when `Antigravity IDE` and `Antigravity` both exist**: prefer the candidate that actually has `state.vscdb`. Thanks @A-Gan for the idea and scenario reference in #1314.
- **Fixed Local API Service 404 for Responses URLs wrongly appended to a Chat Completions base**: `/v1/chat/completions/v1/responses` (and compact) route to the Responses handlers. Thanks @lawyer112 for the idea and scenario reference in #932.
- **Fixed Windows updater falling back to NSIS when the install bundle type cannot be proven**: unknown bundle type now falls back to MSI. Thanks @snvtac for the idea and scenario reference in #1320.
- **Fixed Grok CLI auth and background-refresh races that caused 401s or lost quota**: billing/user calls send the required auth header; soft refresh adopts CLI-rotated local credentials first, retries on invalid grants, and keeps cached quota when a query fails.
- **Fixed Codex / Grok multi-account batch quota refresh failures under high concurrency**: Codex group and local-access batch refresh go through a backend concurrency limit; Grok full refresh is similarly limited and retries billing transport failures with short backoff; Grok progress bars use remaining percent for width.
- **Fixed Codex API Service cost estimates that disagreed with tier, long-context, and service_tier handling**: Priority uses absolute rates when present, otherwise a multiplier; long-context adjusts input/cache/output rates for the whole session when total input exceeds the threshold; the default book covers available models such as GPT-5.6.
- **Fixed “Add to API Service” member-row plan/column misalignment and hard-to-hit backup toggles**: columns stay aligned; clicking the email selects the row, and the full backup control toggles backup without fighting row selection.
- **Fixed Codex API Service members sometimes appearing empty during startup**: persisted members remain intact until the account list finishes its first load, late stale state responses are ignored, and the dialog can still be closed while loading or saving instead of appearing frozen.
- **Fixed Windows and Linux release-package build failures**: enabled the Windows system API features required for process detection and removed invalid tray attributes left behind after Gemini CLI removal.

---
## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- **Added Grok CLI (Grok Build) platform account management**: supports xAI Device OAuth and API Key accounts, local and auth.json / JSON import-export, real default-client account switching, reauthorization after credential failure, per-account working directories for launch, quota queries and alerts, tags and filters, batch operations, CLI path settings, and isolated multi-instance profiles via `GROK_HOME` on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- **Codex account import can sync eligible accounts into the API Service pool**: after a successful import, matching accounts can be appended automatically based on preference, with skip reasons for ineligible accounts and a follow-up guide to open API Service.
- **Codex API Service custom routing supports backup accounts**: accounts marked as backup are used only when every regular account is unavailable; new requests prefer the regular pool again once it recovers.
- **Accounts added or imported inside a group join that group automatically**: opening Add Account from a group assigns successful OAuth, token, local, and file imports to the current group for Codex and Antigravity. Thanks @yxc0915 for #1525.
- **Codex can show or hide model-specific quota rows**: a quick setting toggles additional quota lines such as GPT-5.3, defaults to visible, remembers the preference, and applies to account cards and instance previews. Thanks @iwillwill-ALLWILL for #1424.

### Changed

- **Codex plan filters and quota summaries support dynamic plans**: local access, custom routing, wakeup, and model-provider binding share the same plan-filter and quota-summary rules instead of a fixed plan list.
- **Codex API Service request logs show account display names**: log rows prefer the account presentation name so multi-account traffic under one API key is easier to tell apart. Thanks @lcpdeb for #1312.
- **Windows CLI and background process launching is more consistent**: console windows stay hidden by default on related startup paths, reducing black-console flashes during use.

### Fixed

- **Fixed high CPU and memory usage on long Codex API Service conversations**: input role/metadata and built-in tool normalization now run in linear passes instead of repeatedly scanning the full JSON document for every item, while explicit proxies reuse HTTP transports to reduce connection and allocation overhead.
- **Fixed Codex overview filters that looked like missing accounts**: when group, tag, search, plan, or folder filters hide some accounts, the page shows visible/total counts, lists active filter chips, and offers one-click clear-all; plan “All” is labeled as all plans so it is not confused with the full account list; stale group filter IDs are dropped after groups load.
- **Fixed auto-switch “all accounts” scope keeping a stale selected-ID list**: switching to or loading `all_accounts` clears residual selected account IDs for Codex and Antigravity so config matches runtime (which already monitors every account in that mode).
- **Fixed Cockpit startup automatically rewriting Codex configuration**: enabled Codex API Service and sidecar processes still recover automatically with Cockpit, but startup no longer takes over or restores Codex profiles and does not rewrite `config.toml` or `auth.json`; existing writes now occur only after explicit service enable/disable, account switching, binding, or instance launch actions.
- **Fixed Codex API Key switch and sidecar rebuild writing a localhost upstream `base-url`**: local-access runtime endpoints are no longer synced back into the account's real upstream URL; sidecar `codex-api-key` entries avoid loopback addresses and try to recover the real Base URL from model-provider config, preventing gateway `no auth available` failures. See #1526.
- **Fixed Codex batch-import task bars that stayed on the account page after a failed or empty import**: closing an invalid preview discards the task, and the sticky task bar can also be dismissed manually. See #1445.
- **Fixed Codex CLI / Node discovery when installed via nvm, fnm, or asdf under GUI launches**: wakeup and CLI detection now scan common version-manager directories. See #1496.
- **Fixed Codex account cards showing noisy GPT-5.3 Codex Spark additional quota rows**: Spark-related additional rate-limit windows are hidden from the default account presentation. See #1523.
- **Fixed Codex request-log error tooltips showing only truncated text**: the list still shows a compact message, while hover reveals the full error detail. Thanks @lcpdeb for #1319.
- **Fixed account-group saves that looked successful after a disk write failure**: failed writes now surface as errors instead of leaving a false-success cache state. Thanks @yxc0915 for #1525.

---
## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added

- **Added ZCode platform account management**: supports Z.ai and BigModel OAuth and API Key accounts, local and JSON import/export, real account switching, quota queries, tags, filters, batch operations, launch-path settings, and isolated multi-instance management on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- **Antigravity accounts can now use a persistent custom order**: select custom sorting to arrange accounts by dragging or with move buttons, reopen the editor from the toolbar, and keep the order across reloads as accounts are added or removed. Thanks @khanra17 for #1501.
- **Codex model providers can enable Responses WebSocket per provider**: each provider can persist its WebSocket transport capability, which is synchronized to the account and Codex configuration when adding accounts, editing credentials, switching providers, or starting instances; Chat Completions and built-in OpenAI remain disabled. Thanks @longwQaQ for #1512.

### Changed

- **Codex model loading now uses dynamic discovery**: removed the CDP-based `codex_model_injector` and Cockpit-managed static model catalog overrides; the official client now discovers models from the active provider or profile-local gateway, while user-defined model catalogs remain intact.
- **Codex Chat Completions providers now use stable client model aliases**: upstream models are mapped to official-client-compatible model slots and translated back before requests are sent, with generated profile overrides cleaned up when no longer needed.
- **Codex OAuth offers an in-app incognito WebView on macOS**: Windows and Linux continue to use the regular browser and manual callback flow without showing this option.

### Fixed

- **Fixed legacy Antigravity launch fallback opening Antigravity IDE on Windows**: taskbar shortcut matching now excludes Antigravity IDE when Cockpit is launching the legacy Antigravity app. Thanks @khanra17 for #1453.

---
## [1.1.10] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed

- **Client Key usage ranges now follow local calendar boundaries**: daily usage starts at local midnight, weekly usage starts Monday at local midnight, and monthly usage starts on the first day of the month instead of using rolling 24-hour, 7-day, and 30-day windows. The range labels now read Today, This week, and This month.

---
## [1.1.9] - 2026-07-11

### Changed

- **Client Key routing and usage are easier to scan**: the shared usage range now sits above the service totals, identifies its rolling 24-hour, 7-day, or 30-day window, and each Key separates its routing-account scope from labeled request, token, success-rate, and estimated-cost metrics.

### Fixed

- **Refreshing statistics now expires old events from rolling windows**: state snapshots recompute all three time windows against the current time, while switching the range updates the already-loaded view immediately without waiting for another backend reload.

---
## [1.1.8] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed

- **Client Key usage now refreshes reliably when switching daily, weekly, and monthly ranges**: range changes reload the latest local statistics and rebuild each Key's request, token, success-rate, and cost view from the selected window.
- **Local Windows packages now include a sidecar compatible with OAuth quota-reserve startup arguments**.

---
## [1.1.7] - 2026-07-10

### Changed

- **Compact per-client-key token usage**: client-key rows now render token totals with the same compact notation as service totals, such as `56.7M`.

---
## [1.1.6] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed

- **Fixed Codex API Service compatibility snippets duplicating `/v1`**: OpenAI and Responses now use the service's existing `/v1` base URL, while Anthropic, Gemini, and Ollama receive the correct service-root paths.

---
## [1.1.5] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- **Codex API Service client keys can use independent account-pool scopes**: each key can inherit the service pool or select its own OAuth and API Key accounts, with the selected scope shown alongside that key's request, token, success-rate, and estimate totals.
- **Codex API Service can protect quota on its bound OAuth account**: separate 1-100% reserves can be configured for the 5-hour and weekly windows; HTTP, WebSocket, embedded-gateway, sidecar, and session-affinity routing remove only the bound account from the eligible pool when either remaining quota reaches its reserve, while missing, stale, invalid, or failed quota snapshots fail closed.
- **OAuth quota protection is continuously monitored and visible**: while API Service is running, the bound account quota refreshes every minute and after successful use with request throttling; sidecar mode hot-reloads the dynamic quota snapshot without restarting, and the Codex account card shows the effective window, remaining quota, and reserve when quota is near or below the configured threshold.

### Changed

- **Announcement popups now work across the entire app**: announcements are checked from a persistent app-level host instead of only when the dashboard is open, with throttled background, focus, and visibility refreshes; popups wait for existing dialogs to close and do not repeat when navigating between pages.
- **Codex account selectors now share the account-overview behavior**: overview search state is persisted, and the API Service member picker plus OAuth binding selector reuse the same search, plan and validity, tag, group, sort direction, and custom-order rules; OAuth accounts without a usable `refresh_token` remain visible but disabled with an explanation instead of disappearing from the picker.
- **Codex API Key usage refresh is centralized across account views**: scheduled refreshes update eligible API Key accounts, and cached usage is shared between the dashboard, account overview, and model provider manager; providers without usage-query support are remembered to avoid repeated requests, while manual refresh can force a retry.
- **Desktop updates and release assets now resolve the exact target**: Windows MSI and NSIS, macOS Apple Silicon and Intel, and Linux AppImage, DEB, and RPM packages for x86_64 and ARM64 receive separate signed manifests and stable asset names; legacy `latest.json` remains available until all target builds finish so older clients do not receive incomplete release metadata.

### Fixed

- **Fixed scoped client keys bypassing their selected account pool at the sidecar**: account IDs are now carried into the sidecar manifest and enforced before credential selection.
- **Fixed session affinity leaking an account choice between client API keys**: affinity cache entries are now namespaced by client key, so different keys may safely use the same downstream session identifier without crossing account-pool scopes.
- **Fixed the release metadata version drift**: frontend, Tauri, and lockfile package versions now stay aligned.
- **Fixed Codex 5.6 Responses Lite request compatibility**: `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, and `gpt-5.6-luna` now advertise and enforce disabled parallel tool calls, the Responses Lite header is preserved across `/responses`, `/responses/compact`, HTTP, and WebSocket paths, and non-Lite models retain an explicit `parallel_tool_calls: false` setting.
- **Fixed Windows official ChatGPT launch-path migration**: discovery now prefers the ChatGPT Store package over legacy Codex packages, migrates saved official Codex Store paths when ChatGPT is available, rejects keyword-matching helper executables, and preserves custom executable paths.
- **Fixed invalid Codex quota responses being treated as fully available**: missing or out-of-range `used_percent` values and account-preparation failures are persisted as refresh errors instead of producing misleading remaining quota or bypassing quota protection.

---
## [1.1.4] - 2026-07-10

### Changed

- **Expanded Codex 5.6 model catalog compatibility**: official-client and API Service model responses now preserve the display names, ordering, default and supported reasoning levels, Ultra capability, and priority service tier metadata for `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, and `gpt-5.6-luna`.
- **Improved Codex API Service streaming compatibility through proxies**: requests to `chatgpt.com` now use the standard Go HTTP transport instead of the custom uTLS HTTP/2 connection that could produce `tls: bad record MAC`; Anthropic continues to use its existing uTLS transport.

---
## [1.1.3] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- **Added support for the latest official Codex 5.6 model entries**: API Service, managed official-client model catalogs, and wakeup model presets now include `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, and `gpt-5.6-luna`; existing users receive the new presets without replacing custom presets.

### Changed

- **Codex OAuth API Service compatibility is closer to the official client**: OAuth-backed text conversations no longer inject the hosted `image_generation` tool, while image endpoints remain available and API Key accounts keep their existing image-generation behavior.
- **Codex local access profile takeover keeps managed model catalogs refreshed**: already-attached official client profiles are rewritten when needed so updated model catalogs continue to reach the client.
- **Settings no longer shows the top promotion banner by default**.

### Fixed

- **Fixed Codex API Service requests that mix official `image_gen.imagegen` tools with hosted `image_generation`**: the Rust gateway and Go sidecar now remove the hosted image tool and matching `tool_choice` when the official image tool is already present.

---
## [1.1.2] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- **Added support for the official Codex client renamed to ChatGPT**: launch-path detection, Store/Appx discovery, process scanning, window focus, and app-server resolution now recognize both ChatGPT and legacy Codex clients on Windows and macOS.

---
## [1.1.1] - 2026-07-08

### Changed

- **Chinese app multi-open terminology is unified**: Chinese UI, docs, announcements, and runtime messages consistently use `应用多开`.
- **Codex wakeup and API Service model lists now prefer current GPT-5.4+ models**: legacy GPT-5.1 through GPT-5.3 Codex presets are pruned from defaults and migrated out of existing wakeup presets, while the official wakeup fallback uses `gpt-5.4`.
- **Antigravity suite navigation is more consistent**: Antigravity instances, wakeup tasks, and wakeup verification stay in the Antigravity suite context and are available from the overview tab header.

### Fixed

- **Fixed Codex token refresh authority conflicts between Cockpit and API Service**: the API Service sidecar no longer performs its own OAuth auto-refresh when launched by Cockpit, and refreshed Cockpit tokens are written through to sidecar auth files to reduce `refresh_token_reused` failures. Thanks @wuuconix for #1442.
- **Improved Codex API Service performance with large account pools**: starting, stopping, and rebuilding the local sidecar configuration now avoids unnecessary auth-file rewrites, removes only stale auth files, and does not start the gateway just to disable it.
- **Reduced app-exit stalls caused by Codex API Service shutdown**: app exit now schedules local gateway cleanup asynchronously instead of blocking the main Tauri event loop.
- **Fixed Codex sensitive note metadata being dropped during import**: JSON, auth-file, batch, access-token, refresh-token, and full-token imports now preserve password, 2FA secret, phone number, mail query URL, and notes when present.
- **Fixed dropdown and instance account-picker jitter**: dropdown panels no longer recalculate position from their own internal scrolling, selected items scroll into view without smooth-scroll loops, and repeated identical placement updates are skipped.
- **Fixed tag editing state when switching Codex accounts**: opening the tag editor for another account resets the modal to that account's tags and notes.
- **Improved dark-mode tag filter visibility**: single tag filter controls have clearer contrast and active styling in dark mode.

---
## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- **Trae suite support**: Trae, TRAE SOLO, Trae CN, and TRAE SOLO CN now support local import, OAuth login, account switching with each client's real on-disk rules, quota refresh, launch-path settings, app icons, dashboard entries, and default grouping under Trae.
- **Trae suite authorization is separated by client and region**: international and CN clients use their own authorization, callback, token exchange, refresh, and local storage rules so accounts from different Trae clients stay isolated.
- **Codex account notes now include delivery fields and mail-code preview**: account notes can store password, 2FA secret, mail query URL, phone number, and remarks; mail query URLs can be refreshed, opened in the browser, copied, and preview the first continuous six-digit verification code found outside HTML tags.
- **Codex pending OAuth drafts, browser imports, and exports support the new note fields**: pending authorization cards can keep the same note details before authorization finishes, and supported export formats can include sensitive note fields only when explicitly enabled.
- **Codex account cards can show additional rate-limit data**: more locally available plan and rate-limit fields are preserved and displayed. Thanks @iwillwill-ALLWILL for #1405.
- **Codex API Key account bundles can sync managed model catalogs**: custom Responses API Key bundles write an account-specific model catalog, include the auto-review model when needed, and clean up the managed catalog when it no longer applies. Thanks @usertianziyang for #1429.

### Changed

- **Navigation and account overview state persist more predictably**: the app remembers the selected page, account overview filters, intentionally empty filter values, temporary tab filter state, and selected tabs more consistently. Thanks @xdd666t for #1351.

### Fixed

- **Fixed Codex opaque access-token imports and access-token-only account switching**: `at-...` credentials and access-token-only accounts can be imported, switched, and reported with clearer status without inventing a refresh token. Thanks @iwillwill-ALLWILL for #1412 and #1425.
- **Fixed macOS startup-minimized behavior**: startup minimized with a hidden Dock icon no longer shows the main window briefly before hiding. Thanks @FateLightX for #1406.
- **Fixed Windows Antigravity legacy current-account readback**: legacy account detection now handles system credential mode. Thanks @khanra17 for #1370.

---
## [1.0.5] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- **Codex can filter by real plan types such as `K12`**: these accounts are easier to find and clean up.
- **Codex account overview now includes one-click wakeup tests**: OAuth accounts can be selected quickly for wakeup checks.
- **Codex API Service now supports first-account routing**: requests can stay on the first account in the account pool.
- **Codex request logs now support estimate recalculation**: historical request estimates can be recalculated with current model prices.
- **Codex session visibility repair now supports previews**: users can preview the affected scope before running a repair.
- **Codex sessions now support export previews, import/export, and background progress**: users can confirm the session list, total size, and save location before export, import packages into a target instance, and track transfers with a minimizable progress dialog.
- **Codex sessions now include Trash management**: users can review Trash size, restore sessions, or permanently delete one, selected, or all trashed sessions.
- **Codex account notes now show a copyable email**: the note dialog shows the account email for easier sign-in and account checks.

### Changed

- **Improved background performance**: large account lists create less background refresh, request, and UI pressure.
- **Improved Codex batch import and batch deletion**: flows now support continuation, background progress, and failed-item retry.
- **Improved the Codex account-note 2FA picker**: the dropdown shows secret names, notes, current codes, and short secret previews more clearly.
- **Unified bulk selection across platform account pages**: Cursor, Gemini, GitHub Copilot, Kiro, Qoder, Trae, Windsurf, Zed, and CodeBuddy account pages now use a consistent bulk action flow.
- **Improved top banner stability**: temporary remote config failures no longer make the banner state jump around.

### Fixed

- **Fixed Codex account list and deletion errors caused by stale index records**.
- **Fixed Codex saves possibly overwriting existing configuration fields**.
- **Fixed Codex token refresh and API Service 401 retry issues**.
- **Fixed Codex session lists sometimes using inaccurate ordering**.
- **Fixed app update relaunch being blocked by API Service shutdown failures**.
- **Improved multi-platform switching, launch path detection, and current-account readback**.
- **Improved Cursor and Zed error messages**: authorization failures and 401 issues are easier to diagnose.

---
## [1.0.4] - 2026-07-04

### Important Notice

We are sorry for the disruption caused by the platform package and hot-update changes introduced in `1.0.1` through `1.0.3`. In some environments, those changes caused package installation, upgrade, account switching, and Codex API service issues. For `1.0.4`, we are rolling the app implementation back to the stable `0.26.5` baseline so account management, switching, and core workflows remain reliable.

The platform package work will be redesigned and verified more carefully before it returns. Users on `1.0.x` can upgrade directly to `1.0.4` without manually downgrading.

### Changed

- **Restored the stable `0.26.5` implementation**: temporarily rolls back platform package, bundled package, and remote platform UI changes.
- **Restored the previous account and switching flows**: account lists, authorization, switching, tray state, and related core workflows return to the stable `0.26.5` behavior.
- **Paused the official platform zip hot-update channel**: package installation, upgrade, rollback, and host compatibility rules will be reviewed before this capability is reintroduced.

### Known Notes

- `1.0.4` does not include the platform package capabilities added in `1.0.1` through `1.0.3`.
- If a user already installed `1.0.x` platform packages, this version prioritizes restoring the previous host-managed behavior; platform package cleanup and redesign will be handled separately.

---
## [0.26.5] - 2026-06-20

### Added
- **Codex model providers can now be tested in one batch**: the model provider page can select saved providers, run real conversation tests through the local gateway, show the tested protocol and model, and select failed or unused providers for deletion together with their linked Codex API Key accounts.
- **Codex model providers now support custom ordering**: provider cards can be arranged manually with the same style of ordering controls used by account overviews.

### Changed
- **Codex model-provider tests now reuse the same local gateway paths as real use**: Responses-native providers test through the regular API Key account pool, Chat Completions providers test through provider gateway, and test requests carry provider, key, model, and run diagnostics to upstream-compatible services.
- **Codex binding and test flows now handle `image_generation` compatibility consistently**: API Key, API Service, and model-provider OAuth binding can disable the `image_generation` tool for text conversations, while API Service and provider tests temporarily apply the same text-only filter without removing image models.
- **Codex API Service now keeps session affinity enabled by default**: new and migrated local gateway configurations prefer stable routing for the same conversation, reducing account-switch churn and the chance of triggering provider risk controls, while still allowing users to turn it off later.

### Fixed
- **Codex sidecar streaming retries are less aggressive after retryable failures**: bootstrap retries now use throttled backoff delays and clearer unavailable-auth status handling, reducing dense retry bursts during transient failures. Thanks @lcpdeb for the contribution in #1268.
- **Responses-native Codex API Key accounts bound to OAuth now use the profile local gateway when `image_generation` is disabled**: official Codex profiles route text conversations through localhost for filtering, while Chat Completions accounts continue to use the instance provider gateway branch.
- **Codex local gateway filtering now wins after payload overrides**: when text conversations disable `image_generation`, payload rules can no longer re-add the hosted image tool before the upstream request.
- **Codex instance binding changes no longer leave stale profile sidecars running**: switching a profile from a gateway-backed provider to a regular account, API Service, or another provider stops the old sidecar before applying the new binding.
- **Codex API Key cards keep provider switching available in the card body**: the duplicate bottom action remains removed, but the inline provider switch entry is available again for saved provider changes.

---
## [0.26.4] - 2026-06-19

### Added
- **Claude Desktop launch targets are easier to choose on Windows**: Settings and quick settings can scan WindowsApps, Start menu entries, and a custom scan root, then let users pick either the Microsoft Store app target or a real `Claude.exe`.
- **Codex reset-credit details are clearer**: Codex accounts can show available reset credits with richer detail and expiry information before users choose to reset usage.

### Changed
- **Claude default and multi-instance startup paths are separated more clearly**: the default desktop account can use the official Windows app target, while multi-instance launches guide users to select a real `Claude.exe` path.

### Fixed
- **Windows Claude startup and path scanning no longer flash black command windows**: helper probes now run hidden while resolving Store, WindowsApps, and executable launch targets.
- **Windows in-app updates are less likely to be blocked by background helper processes**: Cockpit now stops its related background components before restart or update so files such as `cockpit-cliproxy.exe` can be replaced cleanly.

---
## [0.26.3] - 2026-06-19

### Added
- **Claude now supports more third-party model services**: when adding a Claude API account, users can choose common providers and have connection details and model setup filled automatically.
- **Claude third-party model setup is easier to complete**: model mappings are generated from available models, so users only need to confirm how real models map to Claude-selectable models, with new mappings filled in automatically when more models are added.

### Changed
- **Claude default-account launch now feels closer to the official app**: switching the default account launches Claude in the normal official flow, while multi-instance launches remain separately managed.
- **Claude third-party account details are more complete**: accounts keep provider, model capability, and display information so account cards and model catalogs stay consistent.
- **Codex API Key account pages are cleaner**: duplicate provider-switch shortcuts have been removed, and card actions stay stable when more buttons are visible or the window is narrow.

### Fixed
- **Codex now fills the correct address when adding APIKEY.FUN accounts**: when APIKEY.FUN or another sponsor provider is selected by default, the account name and Base URL follow that provider instead of the OpenAI address.
- **Claude signed-in accounts recover more easily from stale local paths**: when a usable local sign-in snapshot still exists, the account list can repair the record and reduce false "login unavailable" states.

---
## [0.26.2] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed
- **Codex provider gateway now preserves versioned provider base paths**: Chat Completions providers whose Base URL already includes a version root such as `/api/coding/paas/v4`, `/api/coding/v3`, or `/v2/coding` now route to the provider endpoint without adding an extra `/v1`.
- **Codex wakeup no longer pauses when the legacy CLI is missing**: wakeup state and overview availability now follow the official direct-chat runtime instead of the old CLI probe, and the saved-state notice reflects the backend result.
- **Dashboard Codex API cards look correct in dark mode**: Codex API Key mini cards on the dashboard now use a dark-theme surface instead of inheriting the light sponsor-style gradient.

---
## [0.26.1] - 2026-06-18

### Added
- **Codex reset credits are now visible and usable**: Codex accounts can show available reset credits and reset the 5-hour quota when credits are available.
- **The app can now start minimized**: General settings now include a startup-minimized option that minimizes the main window after launch while keeping Dock, taskbar, and tray restore available.

### Changed
- **Claude quota refresh now runs silently**: Claude sign-in accounts use local cookies to request the Claude Web API instead of opening an Electron helper in the background.

### Fixed
- **Codex reauthorization now updates the original account**: reauthorizing an expired Codex OAuth account updates the selected account instead of creating a duplicate, and removes duplicate records with the same identity when possible.
- **Trae login now works with the latest official flow**: Trae authorization has been updated for the current official client behavior, fixing recent login failures.
- **GitHub Copilot login now supports the latest authorization flow**: GitHub Copilot authorization has been updated to fix recent login failures.
- **Codex provider gateway tool use is more stable**: Claude Code tool calls routed through Codex no longer leak unmatched tool-call records to upstream responses.

---
## [0.26.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added
- **Claude platform management is now available**: Cockpit can manage Claude and Claude CLI accounts in one workspace and show them as one Claude platform across navigation, dashboard, layout, and floating cards. It supports Claude sign-in, Claude Code OAuth/API Key accounts, Claude Gateway provider setup, quota and identity cards, APIKEY.FUN prefill, and separate Claude/CLI instance launch flows.
- **Antigravity now distinguishes Desktop and IDE instance management**: Antigravity and Antigravity IDE use separate launch/runtime targets, icons, instance stores, and PID detection so each client can be managed independently.

### Changed
- **Codex session visibility repair keeps switching lightweight**: account/API switches no longer run heavyweight repairs inline, while the manual repair dialog keeps selectable repair depth, progress feedback, and session-level targeting.
- **Account import/export and modal flows are more consistent**: export dialogs, group pickers, destructive confirmations, and modal error handling use the shared preview/confirmation patterns more consistently across platforms.

---
## [0.25.7] - 2026-06-15

### Added
- **APIKEY.FUN now has a fuller key workspace**: saved keys can retain the last queried balance, automatically reload the first saved key when the page opens, show usage details, read the current key's available model list, and prefill Codex provider setup without directly creating the target account.
- **Codex session management now supports targeted session copy and recovery workflows**: selected sessions can be copied to a target instance, moved to the trash, restored later, selected across all projects, and inspected with copied session IDs while target instance choices follow the same order as the instance list.

### Changed
- **Gemini quota display now uses quota-summary buckets**: Gemini quota refresh reads `retrieveUserQuotaSummary` so account pages, dashboard cards, tray items, and native menus can show Gemini and third-party 5-hour and weekly quota windows more consistently. Thanks @xdd666t.
- **Codex session visibility repair now separates light and deep paths**: post-switch automatic repair only updates the `state_5.sqlite` session records used by the official sidebar, while manual Repair Visibility can choose deep repair to scan rollouts, `session_index.jsonl`, and SQLite indexes before rebuilding the official sidebar state.
- **Codex fast service tier now maps to `priority` more reliably**: fast-tier requests preserve the intended priority behavior through local access, instance launch, Responses payload conversion, and sidecar manifests. Thanks @lcpdeb.
- **Model-provider usage querying is shared across Codex and APIKEY.FUN**: provider balance and usage checks now use a common service path, keep cached usage visible while refreshing, and classify unsupported usage endpoints consistently.

### Fixed
- **Windows Codex account switching now closes the real running app**: switching the default account also matches Store/default-launched Codex processes that use the official app data directory instead of the managed directory.
- **Windows Codex launch argument handling is more robust**: empty argument lists and Windows command construction are handled more defensively during Codex startup. Thanks @lcpdeb.
- **Codex session copy and restore are safer for duplicate sessions**: restoring or copying a session now treats an existing identical session as idempotent, avoids overwriting different sessions, and keeps session index metadata aligned with the restored rollout.
- **Codex API Service startup failures now carry better diagnostics**: the sidecar reports startup stages and the desktop app waits longer for the ready event, making startup timeout errors easier to diagnose.

---
## [0.25.6] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Codex API Service now exposes broader protocol-compatible endpoints**: the same local service can serve OpenAI Chat and Responses, Anthropic Messages and token counting, Gemini model/generation/count-token routes, and Ollama model/chat routes, with provider-gateway translation for Chat Completions-backed accounts.
- **Codex API Service now shows protocol connection examples**: the API Service page lists copyable OpenAI, Responses, Anthropic, Gemini, and Ollama environment snippets plus the supported model-catalog endpoints.

### Changed
- **Codex account deletion is now lightweight for large account sets**: deleting accounts removes the account records and the API Service main account-pool entries without scanning remaining accounts, clearing deep API Service references, or reloading the gateway.
- **Codex batch file import skips quota checks by default**: file import now parses files into the existing selectable preview list first, keeps quota checks behind an opt-in toggle, and preserves the import-selected flow.
- **Codex account bulk actions can now target all matching results**: after selecting the current page, users can explicitly select every account matching the current filters before deleting or moving them to a group.

### Fixed
- **Codex Chat Completions providers can start through their instance provider gateway again**: provider-gateway accounts now use their own eligibility check while the global API Service regular account pool continues to exclude Chat Completions API Key accounts.
- **Codex quota refresh failures now update the account list state**: when a usage request records a quota error such as an invalidated token, the account list and current account state are reloaded even though the refresh action returns an error.
- **Windows Antigravity shortcut launches now resolve the real app process more reliably**: launching through a pinned shortcut hides the helper console output and waits briefly for the actual Antigravity PID instead of returning only the transient `cmd` process.
- **Windows Antigravity account switching and auto-start no longer create duplicate taskbar icons**: launching through the managed shortcut path now avoids leaving an extra taskbar entry during account switching or automatic startup.

---
## [0.25.5] - 2026-06-08

### Changed
- **Antigravity IDE and Antigravity account switching now preserve official OAuth metadata**: OAuth imports, refreshes, local IDE state injection, account records, and official Language Server wakeup now keep the OAuth client key and `id_token`, and Antigravity IDE local state updates `userStatus` plus enterprise project preferences from the same token metadata.
- **Antigravity Desktop account switching now follows one auth write path per client version**: Antigravity 2.0+ writes the system credential path, while older Desktop builds keep using the SQLite state database, avoiding mixed credential writes during switching.

### Added
- **Codex default-account switching can now mirror auth state into WSL on Windows**: settings and quick settings expose a WSL Codex directory option, and default account switching writes the selected `auth.json` and `config.toml` projection into that directory, including API Key accounts bound to OAuth.

### Fixed
- **Antigravity non-enterprise switching clears stale enterprise preferences**: switching away from enterprise accounts removes the previous enterprise project preference from the local IDE state.
- **Windows WSL and proxy helper probes no longer flash console windows**: WSL network-prefix detection and Windows registry proxy lookup now launch their helper subprocesses with hidden console flags.

---
## [0.25.4] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- **WebDAV and local backup retention days can now be configured independently**: WebDAV backup cleanup can use its own retention policy instead of sharing the local backup retention setting.

### Changed
- **Codex API Service account-pool changes now return without waiting for a gateway reload**: saving API Service members and removing deleted accounts from the pool update local state first and trigger a single background gateway reload, keeping the add/delete flows responsive on large account sets.
- **Large Codex account pickers now paginate their results**: the API Service member picker and Codex wakeup account pickers show paged account lists, reducing UI work when more than 1,000 accounts are present.
- **Codex account-page large-list work is more focused**: API Service member saving reuses the current account snapshot instead of issuing another full account read, and team-account profile hydration only targets the current page.
- **APIKEY.FUN presentation is clearer in dark mode**: the partner relay copy now says “official Cockpit partner relay”, and the APIKEY.FUN page adds dark-theme styling for panels, inputs, buttons, cards, messages, and key rows.

### Fixed
- **Deleted Codex accounts are fully removed from API Service references**: account pools, scoped API keys, custom routing rules, account model rules, runtime cache, response affinity, cooldowns, and bound OAuth references are cleaned when accounts are deleted.
- **Codex API Service sidecar no longer restarts for quota-only manifest changes**: sidecar fingerprints ignore volatile remaining-quota fields while still detecting real routing and account changes.
- **Codex API Service excludes Chat Completions API Key accounts from the regular account pool**: accounts that require the instance-specific provider gateway are no longer selectable for the global API Service pool, and the member picker shows an explicit unsupported status.
- **Codex API Service is more stable on large local datasets and large requests**: startup raises the process file-descriptor soft limit on macOS/Linux, oversized declared HTTP request bodies are rejected before reading, and the sidecar can resolve macOS/Windows system proxy settings into an explicit upstream proxy URL.
- **CLIProxyAPI sidecar preserves Codex reasoning effort for manifest models**: model registry entries now keep static thinking support for Codex models and aliases, so requests such as `reasoning.effort = high` survive the sidecar translation path.
- **Restoring backups no longer overwrites unrelated configuration fields**: import and restore flows preserve configuration values outside the restored backup scope.
- **MFA backup fields are handled more safely during backup transfer**: backup import/export avoids unsafe dynamic handling of MFA backup fields while keeping the related locale keys in sync.
- **WebDAV service URL input now aligns with the other settings fields**: the WebDAV address field uses the same width behavior as neighboring settings controls.
- **Pull request builds are more reliable on Windows runners**: PR builds now use the dedicated Tauri CI config file instead of inline JSON arguments that can be misparsed by Windows shells.

---
## [0.25.3] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed
- **Codex Chat Completions providers now use isolated local gateways per instance**: API Key accounts configured for Chat Completions start a dedicated provider gateway for the target Codex profile with its own local port, avoiding conflicts with the global API Service gateway or other Codex instances.
- **Codex default-instance process matching now follows the official client launch shape**: the default desktop instance is detected without requiring `CODEX_HOME` or a managed profile directory, improving launch state, stop behavior, PID tracking, and window focus for the official default instance.
- **Codex config.toml cleanup no longer removes user-managed provider settings**: Cockpit now only removes its own provider-gateway model catalog and model override, preserving external `model_catalog_json`, custom providers, and other user configuration.
- **Windows provider-gateway sidecars no longer open visible console windows**: background sidecars launched for Codex provider gateways keep the Windows hidden-console startup behavior.

---
## [0.25.2] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- **Codex Chat Completions providers can now launch directly from account switching**: API Key accounts configured for Chat Completions, including common domestic model providers, automatically enable the local provider gateway, write the model catalog, and select the provider model when switching accounts.
- **Codex API Key accounts can be edited again**: account cards and account lists restore the edit action for saved API Key accounts, allowing users to update the key, Base URL, protocol, model catalog, vision capability map, and vision routing model without recreating the account.
- **Codex batch import is easier to monitor and control**: importing multiple JSON files now scans accounts one by one, shows live progress, summary stats, and a flat account list, supports resuming after cancellation, provides quick selection for all or healthy accounts, and still lets users manually include abnormal accounts before importing.
- **Codex provider gateway now supports explicit vision routing**: providers can configure a default vision routing model so image requests move to a capable model when the selected model does not support images.
- **Codex default-instance launching is more reliable across macOS and Windows**: default Codex launches use the platform app entry where possible, probe the launched process more accurately, and fall back to the executable path when the system entry cannot be resolved.

### Changed
- **Codex provider image handling is now predictable**: unsupported image input returns `unsupported_image_input` when no routing model is configured, while routed image requests preserve the original image payload instead of replacing it with placeholder text.
- **Codex model injection is narrower and less intrusive**: the injector now targets the specific Statsig config ID (`107580212`), removes broad object-graph traversal, and marks the simplified behavior with injector version `2`.
- **Codex provider management is easier to scan**: provider cards use shorter labels, and provider settings include clearer vision-model and routing-model guidance.
- **Original sidebar spacing is tighter**: the capsule sidebar uses smaller padding and item gaps so the original layout feels less sparse.

---
## [0.25.1] - 2026-06-06

### Changed
- **Codex model-provider switching is more reliable**: switching between model providers, API Key accounts, and regular accounts now applies to the active Codex configuration sooner and repairs history visibility when needed, reducing cases where conversations disappear after switching.
- **Codex model providers now preserve the user's previous model choice**: switching back from a third-party model provider to a regular account restores the earlier official model selection instead of leaving the previous provider model behind.

### Fixed
- **Fixed Codex launch issues for some Windows installations**: Codex now starts more reliably from Windows Store or protected install locations while keeping the intended instance directory, launch arguments, and environment settings.
- **Fixed third-party models being treated as unavailable by the local gateway**: models already listed in a provider catalog, such as `deepseek-v4-pro`, no longer fail with an incorrect “not available for this API Key” message.
- **Fixed provider protocol choices not being fully saved with API Key accounts**: adding, editing, or quick-switching providers now keeps the selected Responses-native or Chat Completions mode so future launches match the UI configuration.
- **Fixed provider models sometimes not appearing in Codex quickly enough**: when the model catalog is written slightly later than the Codex page loads, Cockpit now waits and patches the model list more reliably.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- **Codex model providers now support a full provider-management workflow**: the Codex model provider page adds multiple API Keys per provider, searchable API Key and instance pickers, provider search/filter/sort, bulk selection and deletion, provider service panels, OAuth binding, and quick enable actions that align with the account page card interactions.
- **Codex third-party API Key quota detection now supports `new-api` and compatible third-party usage providers**: Cockpit detects supported quota endpoints, caches the detected provider type, keeps previous quota data visible, follows the existing quota refresh strategy, and renders provider-specific core metrics across account cards, dashboard cards, model provider cards, service panels, and the macOS menu bar.
- **Codex provider protocol selection is now explicit**: provider setup defaults to Responses-native mode except for known Chat Completions providers, exposes a styled protocol selector with inline help, and only uses the local gateway for Chat Completions providers.
- **WebDAV backup synchronization**: Settings now includes WebDAV backup sync configuration, service wiring, locale coverage, and data-transfer support for synchronizing Cockpit backup data. Thanks @xdd666t.
- **Codex wakeup and session-repair improvements from community PRs**: wakeup requests now include the official `StartCascadeRequest.source` field, and Codex visibility repair reconciles `session_index.jsonl` before repair. Thanks @Slone123c and @andrew05060414.

### Changed
- **Codex model providers can now connect Chat Completions models such as `deepseek-v4-pro`**: Responses-native providers stay in direct mode, while Chat Completions providers use the local gateway for protocol conversion and only show gateway-related model catalog and image-input controls when that protocol is selected.
- **Codex model provider cards and service panels now reuse the account-page quota presentation**: provider cards keep cached quota data visible, expose manual refresh controls, render `new-api` and compatible third-party usage fields with provider-specific layouts, and keep provider details in one scrollable service panel.
- **Codex OAuth login is more stable on Linux**: OAuth callback handling avoids duplicate completion and improves the Linux login flow.

### Fixed
- **Codex provider OAuth binding now takes effect when enabling a model provider**: model provider OAuth binding is synchronized to the actual API Key account used for launch, matching the account page behavior.
- **Codex wakeup through the official Language Server no longer fails because of a missing request source**: wakeup requests now inject the official `StartCascadeRequest.source` field expected by the upstream service. Thanks @Slone123c.
- **Codex session visibility repair now reconciles `session_index.jsonl` before repairing visibility**: the repair flow updates the session index so hidden or stale sessions can be repaired more reliably. Thanks @andrew05060414.

---
## [0.24.12] - 2026-06-03

### Added
- **Codex API Service now more closely follows official Codex client traffic behavior**: sidecar requests use stronger client fingerprinting, reasoning/signature replay support, sanitized request signing, and expanded Responses/WebSocket handling; the maintained Legacy/WebSocket gateway also fills Codex client metadata and turn metadata while dropping invalid reasoning signatures, so account-pool requests look more consistent with official client flows.
- **Codex wakeup tasks now support execution modes**: each Codex wakeup task can run directly or require confirmation with a configurable timeout before execution. Thanks @Ac-spider.

### Changed
- **Codex API Service errors now preserve fuller diagnostics**: local API Service tests, request logs, and upstream failures keep more complete error details so operators can distinguish auth failures, quota failures, proxy issues, and upstream response problems.
- **Codex API Service account-pool health now avoids marking quota-refresh-only failures as abnormal accounts**: non-auth quota refresh failures no longer have the same effect as 401-style authentication failures, reducing unnecessary account exclusion.
- **Codex API Service gateway compatibility is kept across Legacy, Sidecar, and WebSocket paths**: routing, usage capture, image handling, reasoning output, and stream completion behavior are aligned across the maintained gateways instead of favoring a single path.
- **Account-level refresh settings now match platform-level refresh controls**: account overrides use the same preset set as platform defaults and support custom minute values without offering inconsistent 30/60 minute presets. Thanks @Ac-spider.
- **Windows Antigravity Desktop version detection is more reliable**: executable metadata probing passes the target path through the process environment, adds uninstall-registry `DisplayVersion` fallback, and reuses cached version information before choosing the Desktop auth mode. Thanks @insane66613.

### Fixed
- **Codex API Service auth projection no longer writes invalid OAuth auth files for API Key bindings**: API Key accounts bound to OAuth snapshots without `id_token` now keep the API Key auth shape instead of producing an invalid OAuth `auth.json`. Thanks @luoyanglang.
- **External import Deep Links no longer treat the executable name as an import argument**: single-instance and startup import handling skips `argv0`, avoiding misleading diagnostics and failed WSL import handling. Thanks @Disaster-Terminator.
- **Dashboard Antigravity quota cards now display grouped quota data before canonical-model fallback**: accounts whose quota only maps through display groups no longer appear as having no data. Thanks @Hao-Wu.
- **Codex wakeup execution-mode controls now use the standard form styling**: the execution-mode selector keeps the same height, padding, border, focus state, and typography as the rest of the wakeup task form.
- **Codex launch paths are re-detected after updates when the saved path becomes stale**: if the stored Codex launch path no longer resolves, the launch flow detects the current install location and writes it back to configuration, reducing manual path repair after app updates.

---
## [0.24.11] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- **Codex API Service account pools now support account-level disabled model rules**: each account can configure blocked models, apply rules in bulk, and have Legacy, WebSocket, and Sidecar routing avoid accounts that cannot serve the requested model.
- **Codex wakeup tasks now use direct official Codex chat**: wakeup runs through the selected OAuth account without requiring Codex CLI or a running local API Service, follows the saved upstream proxy and timeout settings, parses official streaming responses, and shows the execution result as official direct chat.

### Changed
- **Codex API Service account-pool controls are visually more consistent**: the Codex API/Cockpit API copy, scheduling options, checkboxes, form control heights, and typography now use a more aligned layout.
- **Codex OAuth binding now accepts any OAuth account with `refresh_token`**: binding filters no longer require the account to pass the normal-account validity shortcut, and the binding description matches the actual eligibility rule.
- **Codex launches now repair session visibility when the launch credential changes**: default and managed instance launches run session visibility repair before startup when a credential switch is involved.

### Fixed
- **Codex config.toml managed rewrites now preserve more user configuration**: API account switching no longer rebuilds the entire model provider table, API Service takeover restore keeps current plugin settings, and repeated blank lines are collapsed when writing the active config.
- **Windows Antigravity local account import now reads the current system credential path**: local import uses Windows Credential Manager `gemini:antigravity` credentials and reuses the refresh-token import flow, while non-Windows platforms keep the state database path.

---
## [0.24.10] - 2026-05-31

### Added
- **Codex API Service testing now uses a built-in streaming chat dialog**: the API Service test action opens a dedicated chat dialog, sends real `/v1/chat/completions` requests through the local service, streams assistant output back into the dialog, and no longer depends on Codex CLI execution.
- **Codex API Service cards now show account-pool health at a glance**: the account card and setup panel summarize available, abnormal, and cooled-down accounts while keeping quota-pool statistics separate.
- **Codex multi-instance session records now have a settings panel with manual and automatic sync**: the Codex instances page adds a dedicated record-sync settings dialog, keeps manual full sync available, and can automatically merge local session records only after all Codex instances are stopped.
- **Codex macOS and Windows multi-instance launches now adapt to the latest Codex app runtime**: managed Codex instances on macOS and Windows pass both `CODEX_ELECTRON_USER_DATA_PATH` and `--user-data-dir` so each `CODEX_HOME` gets a stable isolated Electron app data directory.
- **macOS app bundles now include an explicit Info.plist override**: packaged bundles use the Cockpit Tools display name and set `LSRequiresCarbon` to false.
- **Wakeup tasks now support an optional confirmation mode**: scheduled Codex wakeup tasks can notify first, then run only after the user confirms within the timeout window, helping users verify VPN or proxy readiness before wakeup. Thanks @Ac-spider.
- **Accounts can now override automatic refresh intervals individually**: account-level refresh settings can override platform defaults or disable automatic refresh for specific accounts while keeping unset accounts on inherited defaults. Thanks @Ac-spider.

### Changed
- **Codex API Service routing now skips known unhealthy accounts**: accounts with repeated blocking authentication, preparation, free-account restriction, or quota failures are excluded from Legacy routing and Sidecar launch manifests so healthy accounts are preferred.
- **Codex API Service diagnostics now use direct local gateway requests**: service tests call the local OpenAI-compatible endpoint through Cockpit's Tauri backend, avoiding Codex CLI-specific behavior while preserving local gateway, API key, model, and upstream validation.
- **Codex OAuth binding now only allows OAuth accounts with `refresh_token`**: API Key account binding and Codex API Service binding both filter and validate on `refresh_token`, and stale bindings without it are removed during API Service state sanitization.
- **Codex API Service client Base URL host is now configurable**: users can choose `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` for the Base URL written to Codex Provider and copied to clients, without changing the service bind address.
- **Add-account dialogs no longer close when the overlay is clicked**: account add modals across supported platforms stay open unless the user uses the explicit close/back action or Escape.
- **Codex API Service account rows now surface token usage earlier**: account-level statistics show compact token usage beside request result details, and the legacy local access account grid orders metrics before quota.
- **Instance toolbar actions are now compact icon buttons**: create, start all, stop all, refresh, and Codex sync settings controls use consistent icon-only actions with accessible labels.
- **Codex default-instance restarts are faster after account switching and API Service activation**: when the profile has already been prepared, Cockpit skips duplicate bound-account injection and pre-start idle thread sync, uses cached Windows Store AppUserModelId detection, and prefers fast PID-based close/start probes with phase timing logs.
- **`npm run tauri` now prepares the Windows build toolchain before launching Tauri**: the wrapper still runs version sync first, then loads the Visual Studio Build Tools environment and Go binary path on Windows before invoking the local Tauri CLI, with fallback to the existing shell environment when the toolchain hook is unavailable.

### Fixed
- **Tauri startup no longer fails on the notification plugin configuration**: the app configuration no longer passes an invalid object to `plugins.notification`, avoiding a startup panic during application initialization.
- **Antigravity Windows account switching is now more tolerant of version-detection failures**: Cockpit falls back safely when the installed Antigravity version cannot be detected, tries both system credentials and the legacy SQLite state database, and only fails when both injection paths fail. Thanks @xdd666t.
- **Antigravity Windows version detection now passes the executable path as a PowerShell argument**: this avoids path quoting issues, keeps UTF-8 JSON output, and preserves hidden console-window startup behavior.
- **Codex API Service gateway probes no longer duplicate the `/v1` path**: fallback health checks now preserve Base URLs that already include `/v1`, preventing false `endpoint not supported` failures during local API Service diagnostics. Thanks @wjh4sg.
- **Windows Antigravity 2.0 local data directory and process detection now support `Antigravity.exe` installs**: local import, default profile injection, switching, launch, and PID matching prefer the `%APPDATA%\Antigravity` and `Programs\Antigravity` layout while retaining the `Antigravity IDE` fallback. Thanks @li6535202.
- **Antigravity install-version detection now checks common Linux install roots**: Linux detection includes `/usr/share` and `/opt` paths for Antigravity and Antigravity IDE targets. Thanks @vadbes46.
- **Windows Codex multi-instance shared storage no longer depends on symlink privileges**: shared directories now use directory junctions, shared files are copied into instance profiles, and existing reparse-point directory links are recognized during sync.
- **Windows Codex shared-directory junction creation is more reliable**: Cockpit now creates junctions with PowerShell `New-Item -ItemType Junction` first, falls back to a quoted `mklink /J` command, and reports both command results with source and target paths when creation fails.
- **Windows Codex default instance detection now follows the current app data layout more reliably**: the default app user data path recognizes `%APPDATA%\Codex\web\Codex`, filters helper/resource Codex processes from main-process matching, and avoids treating a reused Store-launched instance as a newly started process.
- **Codex managed-process shutdown now verifies that target PIDs actually exited**: graceful and forced close flows recheck the original managed PID set and return a clear manual-close error when a process remains alive instead of silently reporting success.

---
## [0.24.9] - 2026-05-26

### Added
- **CLIProxyAPI sidecar now supports xAI accounts and executor routing**: xAI OAuth, token refresh, model thinking configuration, executor binding, and related service tests are included so xAI accounts can participate in the sidecar account pool.
- **Codex API Service sidecar now exposes OpenAI-compatible image and video endpoints**: `/v1/images/generations`, `/v1/images/edits`, and video handlers are relayed through Codex Responses tooling with streaming, multipart image input, response-format conversion, and usage capture support.
- **CLIProxyAPI sidecar now includes Codex client model catalog generation**: the sidecar can fetch Codex client models, ships a generated Codex model catalog, and uses the catalog alongside built-in model definitions.
- **Home relay mode now supports cluster discovery and mTLS enrollment**: Home JWT enrollment can request and verify client certificates, configure TLS Redis clients, discover cluster nodes, and fail over to healthier Home targets.
- **Codex API Service usage statistics now separate client-canceled and incomplete-stream results**: totals, account rows, and request summaries show successful, failed, canceled, and stream-incomplete counts separately.
- **Codex API Service now exposes configurable timeout and retry controls**: the full API Service page adds advanced controls for Sidecar stream timeouts, image stream timeouts, open attempts, keep-alives, bootstrap retries, Legacy request/upstream/stream timeouts, WebSocket timeouts, upstream send retries, and single-account short retries, with built-in long-wait/short-wait presets and custom preset saving.

### Changed
- **Codex account API provider defaults now prefer OpenAI Official**: the Cockpit API preset is hidden from the normal preset list while existing Cockpit API Base URLs remain recognized as Cockpit-managed custom providers.
- **CLIProxyAPI sidecar request handling now has stronger metadata, logging, and auth-file management**: request metadata, response wrapping, auth-file project IDs, partial auth-file updates, Redis queue handling, and sanitized request logs were expanded with focused coverage.
- **Codex API Service stream handling now uses runtime timeout settings**: Sidecar and Legacy gateways read their stream, WebSocket, retry, and connection timeout profile from the saved API Service configuration instead of relying on fixed in-code values.
- **Codex synced-session metadata rebuild is now best effort**: project index repair continues when metadata rebuild fails and keeps session visibility updates focused on available data. Thanks @OvOYu.

### Fixed
- **Codex local access port changes now remain available after a bind failure**: users can adjust the port after startup binding fails instead of being blocked by the failed state. Thanks @Disaster-Terminator.
- **Codex synced session project visibility now repairs missing or stale project indexes more reliably**: synced thread metadata is rebuilt from available session files and official app metadata without blocking on non-critical rebuild failures. Thanks @OvOYu.
- **Codex account switching now refreshes the local account list before switching**: stale account selections are rejected with a clear message when the account has already disappeared from local storage.
- **Codex API Service now classifies incomplete upstream streams separately from generic failures**: legacy and sidecar errors such as disconnected streams, incomplete EOF, and missing completion events are migrated and counted as `stream_incomplete`.
- **Trae account auth storage now handles iCube cipher records correctly**: encrypted auth records are read and written through the matching cipher-storage path in both the shared core and Tauri modules. Thanks @wuhua111.
- **Forked PR builds no longer require unavailable signing secrets**: the build matrix only applies signing configuration when the required secrets are available. Thanks @OvOYu.

---
## [0.24.8] - 2026-05-25

### Added
- **Codex API Service now supports gateway mode switching between Sidecar and Legacy modes**: gateway mode can be changed from the account card and the full API Service page, request logs record and filter by mode, and logs are tagged as `[sidecar]` or `[legacy]` for easier diagnosis.
- **Codex API Service now exposes a debug log switch**: when enabled, Cockpit records legacy gateway request phases, sidecar executor traces, upstream timing, selected account details, stream completion state, and timeout diagnostics while keeping normal request logs available.
- **Codex API Service now supports the hidden `codex-auto-review` reviewer model in both gateway modes**: Sidecar and Legacy gateways expose the internal reviewer model in local `/v1/models`, mark it hidden in the Codex client model catalog, and forward `/v1/responses` reviewer requests unchanged so Codex automatic approval review no longer fails local model policy validation.
- **Codex API Service now guides users to the gateway switch from the account card**: a one-time opaque guide highlights the new gateway selector without adding the selector back to the quick setup modal.

### Changed
- **Codex API Service now writes the local client Base URL with `localhost`**: generated Codex provider config uses `http://localhost:<port>/v1` instead of `127.0.0.1`, reducing the chance that local proxy stacks intercept the client-to-sidecar loopback request.
- **Codex-launched processes now receive managed loopback proxy bypass settings**: launched Codex CLI and official app-server processes merge inherited `NO_PROXY` / `no_proxy` values with Cockpit-managed loopback entries for `127.0.0.1`, `127.0.0.0/8`, `localhost`, `::1`, and `::1/128`.
- **Sidecar proxy selection now follows the legacy gateway priority**: API Service proxy, Cockpit global proxy, inherited environment proxy, and system/default proxy discovery are resolved through the same priority model used by the old gateway.
- **Codex API Service quick setup modal now stays focused on service setup**: the new/old gateway mode switch was removed from the modal, while the full API Service page and account card remain responsible for mode switching.

### Fixed
- **Codex API Service no longer lets loopback requests get routed through local proxy tools as easily**: Cockpit now injects loopback bypass rules and health diagnostics can identify when Clash/FlyingBird-style local proxies are intercepting `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` API Service traffic.
- **Sidecar streaming now fails fast on startup and idle stalls**: stream-open timeout, retry handling, idle timeout, completion-state validation, and clearer diagnostics prevent long silent hangs before the first byte or after a partial stream.
- **Sidecar startup is more reliable across platforms**: Cockpit waits for the sidecar stdout `ready` event, development builds resolve the local sidecar binary first, Go sidecar sources are tracked by the Tauri build script, and Windows sidecars avoid unreliable parent-PID termination checks.
- **Legacy gateway streaming and WebSocket handling now has stronger timeout and disconnect behavior**: upstream connect, stream idle, stream total timeout, heartbeat flush, broken-pipe classification, and first-chunk/completion diagnostics make long-running requests easier to recover from and debug.
- **Codex API Service request log storage now preserves gateway mode and diagnostics consistently**: database migrations add the gateway mode field and related indexes so full-page request logs can distinguish Sidecar and Legacy traffic.

---
## [0.24.7] - 2026-05-24

### Added
- **Codex API Service now runs through a bundled CLIProxyAPI sidecar and Cockpit relay**: Cockpit Tools builds and packages `cockpit-cliproxy`, generates sidecar config, manifest, and auth files from managed accounts and client keys, keeps the existing Base URL/API key workflow, and relays OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions, Responses, image, streaming, and CORS preflight requests through CLIProxyAPI's Codex executor.
- **Codex API Service now supports model pricing and estimated value statistics**: built-in pricing presets cover current Codex models including `gpt-5.5`, custom USD-per-million token prices can be edited from the model page, and totals, account/model/key breakdowns, and request logs show estimated value from each request's stored price snapshot.
- **Codex API Service request logs now include request-level diagnostics**: sidecar events carry stable request IDs, selected auth/account metadata, HTTP status, retry details, sanitized upstream error messages, client-cancel classifications, and account routing context so failures can be traced from the UI.
- **Codex account subscription terms can now be refreshed manually**: OAuth accounts with missing or expired subscription information expose a refresh action in card and table views, with query attempts, successes, retry windows, and last errors persisted on the account record.
- **Antigravity 2.0 desktop account switching now writes the official system credential**: desktop Antigravity versions `2.0.0` and later write the official `gemini` / `antigravity` credential into macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, or Linux Secret Service, while older desktop builds continue to use the legacy state database path.

### Changed
- **Codex API Service runtime takeover now preserves official Codex profile files**: enabling the service backs up profile `auth.json` and `config.toml` before writing the managed `codex_local_access` provider state, and disabling the service restores backed-up files or removes only Cockpit-owned entries.
- **Codex API Service now keeps the default Codex profile attached while the service is enabled**: state snapshots inspect the default profile, report config/auth attachment status, and retry takeover if the expected Base URL or API key is stale.
- **Codex API Service sidecar now uses Cockpit's relay runtime around CLIProxyAPI v7.0.2**: Cockpit owns the HTTP listener, request policy, model policy, usage capture, and local statistics pipeline while CLIProxyAPI provides Codex auth synthesis, account selection, refresh, retries, and executor behavior.
- **Codex API Service sidecar streaming now normalizes OpenAI-compatible SSE output**: streamed Chat Completions and Responses traffic is framed consistently, JSON chunks and `[DONE]` are converted to SSE when needed, hop-by-hop and proxy-only headers are filtered, and local CORS preflight behavior matches the local gateway.
- **Codex history visibility repair now updates both rollout metadata and `state_5.sqlite` thread rows**: repair backups include the SQLite database when needed, invalid databases are skipped with a clear result message, and the summary reports the number of updated SQLite records.
- **Codex multi-instance launches now detect account/API credential source changes**: launching an instance after switching between managed account credentials and API credentials surfaces the existing session visibility repair dialog and runs the same cross-instance repair flow.
- **Codex API Service request log storage now persists diagnostic and pricing fields**: log rows keep request ID, HTTP status, sanitized error details, estimated USD value, and the input/output/cached-input price snapshot used for that request.
- **Local runtime and configuration persistence now uses shared atomic writes and corrupt-file quarantine**: config, announcements, instance stores, OAuth pending files, wakeup state/history/verification, tray layout, update state, fingerprints, Zed runtime, Codex API state, and Codex API log storage isolate invalid files before rebuilding safe defaults.
- **Antigravity desktop account switching now resolves the installed auth mode dynamically**: Cockpit detects the installed desktop version before switching, writes legacy state DB data only for builds below `2.0.0`, and lets current desktop builds surface their native failure reason directly in the account page.

### Fixed
- **Codex history visibility repair no longer rewrites session chronology when updating rollout files**: rollout provider rewrites, backups, and restores now preserve the original file modification time when possible, and non-critical timestamp restore failures do not block the repair flow.
- **Codex API Service streaming responses no longer leak incompatible upstream headers or malformed chunks**: streaming relay responses now keep one expected event-stream content type, preserve safe upstream headers, drop proxy-only headers, normalize partial SSE frames, and emit `[DONE]` in OpenAI-compatible SSE format.
- **Codex API Service default profile attachment now repairs stale local Base URL or API key state**: when the service is enabled, stale `codex_local_access` provider config is detected and rewritten instead of leaving the official Codex profile pointed at an old port or key.
- **Antigravity desktop launch detection now prefers the current macOS executable name**: legacy Antigravity.app resolution checks `Contents/MacOS/Antigravity` before `Electron`, matching the current desktop package layout.

---
## [0.24.4] - 2026-05-23

### Added
- **Codex API Service now has a dedicated management page**: service status, access URLs, client keys, account pool, model rules, routing options, health state, and request logs can now be managed from one Codex API Service entry.
- **Codex API Service now supports named client API keys and per-key model policies**: keys can be created, renamed, disabled, rotated, deleted, and constrained with model prefixes plus allowed/excluded model lists.
- **Codex API Service now bridges official Codex backend and WebSocket request paths**: `/backend-api/codex/responses`, `/backend-api/codex/responses/compact`, and Responses WebSocket upgrades can run through the local managed-account gateway.
- **Codex API Service now exposes image-generation compatibility through `gpt-image-2`**: `/v1/images/generations` and `/v1/images/edits` are mapped to Codex Responses image tooling with service-level image modes and account capability checks.
- **Codex API Service now records usage statistics and searchable request logs**: daily, weekly, monthly, and all-time usage is tracked by account, model, and client key, with filters for model, account, key, request type, status, and error category.
- **Development runs now have an isolated Cockpit Tools Dev profile**: `npm run tauri:dev` starts the dev app with its own Tauri identifier, data directory, API port, and window branding.

### Changed
- **Codex API Service modal now stays focused on quick setup with a View All Features shortcut**: advanced stats, request logs, image-generation controls, and named key management now live on the dedicated page.
- **Codex API Service routing now includes session affinity, configurable retry behavior, and account health tracking**: repeated turns can stay on one account while cooled-down, exhausted, or image-ineligible accounts are skipped before the next selection.
- **Codex official app speed selection now writes the current official `config.toml` desktop service-tier key**: Standard removes the managed tier and Fast writes `priority`, matching the current Codex client storage.
- **Shared Cockpit data files now resolve through one data-directory path**: account groups, device state, config state, and Codex API Service state follow the same configured or profile-specific data directory.
- **Documentation now includes Portuguese README/donation pages and WSL2 Ubuntu 24 build guidance**: localized project documentation and Linux build notes are available alongside the existing English and Chinese docs.

### Fixed
- **Codex access-token-only and session-token imports no longer get forced into reauthorization because `refresh_token` is missing**: imports accept `session_token`/`sessionToken`, managed projections keep the expected `refresh_token` field, and proactive refresh skips accounts that cannot refresh.
- **Dashboard and platform switching now keep grouped Antigravity/Codex entries consistent**: grouped cards are deduplicated, Codex API Service navigation stays inside the Codex group, and the switcher no longer treats the current extra page as a platform mismatch.

---
## [0.24.3] - 2026-05-21

### Changed
- **Emergency fix for Codex Local API Service routing when no explicit proxy is configured**: API proxy URL, Cockpit global proxy, and environment proxy variables are still preferred in order, while the service now falls through to reqwest's system proxy discovery instead of stopping before the system auto-proxy path can be used.
- **Antigravity installed-version lookup now separates quick badge reads from full scans**: the overview badge starts after a short delay, uses cached metadata when possible, and completes a longer scan in the background so version display does not block the page.
- **Codex plan badges now reuse the raw account plan value with shared styling**: account cards, summaries, and routing views keep backend/local plan labels unchanged while using one presentation path for badge classes.

### Fixed
- **Windows Antigravity 2.0 local data directory and process detection now support `Antigravity.exe` installs**: when the official client is installed under `Programs\Antigravity` and stores user data in `%APPDATA%\Antigravity`, local import, default profile injection, switching, launch, and PID matching prefer that layout while retaining the `Antigravity IDE` fallback.
- **Legacy Antigravity account switching no longer fails when installed-version metadata is unavailable or unparseable**: cached known versions still block Antigravity `2.0.0` and later, while missing cache data allows the legacy path to proceed.
- **Codex custom routing account lists now keep their header and rows within a bounded scroll area**: the modal body scrolls correctly and plan badges keep stable sizing in narrow layouts.

---
## [0.24.2] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- **Emergency fix for Codex Local API Service proxy routing after v0.24.1**: empty API proxy URLs now fall back to the Cockpit global proxy and then explicit environment proxy variables (`HTTPS_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`, or `ALL_PROXY`), and the gateway refuses official upstream requests when no proxy URL is available instead of falling back to unintended direct upstream access.
- **Codex Local API Service upstream failures now identify the active proxy source**: 502 diagnostics and logs report whether the API service proxy, Cockpit global proxy, environment proxy, or missing proxy configuration was used so users can correct network routing quickly.

---
## [0.24.1] - 2026-05-21

### Added
- **Antigravity overview now shows the installed version for the selected target**: the version badge follows the active Antigravity or Antigravity IDE target so users can confirm which local client is being managed.

### Changed
- **Antigravity is now managed as one group with separate Antigravity and Antigravity IDE targets**: Platform Management keeps the Antigravity group first, and the group switcher controls which target is used for overview actions, version lookup, and account switching.
- **Legacy Antigravity switching is now gated by the installed version**: Antigravity versions below `2.0.0` continue to use the legacy disk and launch paths, while Antigravity `2.0.0` and later are blocked with guidance to use Antigravity IDE.
- **Codex Local API Service proxy configuration now uses a dedicated API proxy URL**: the service validates the configured proxy address, applies it only to API upstream traffic, and uses direct upstream access when the address is empty.

### Fixed
- **Antigravity IDE path and version detection now follows the renamed official install layout**: macOS, Windows, and Linux detection distinguish legacy Antigravity from Antigravity IDE and resolve the correct app metadata and executable candidates.

---
## [0.24.0] - 2026-05-20

### Changed
- **Antigravity integration now aligns with the official Antigravity IDE client**: default app paths, user data directories, process detection, wakeup Language Server metadata, README copy, and UI labels now use Antigravity IDE, while local import and account switching read/write the official `antigravityUnifiedStateSync.oauthToken` state.
- **The MFA vault now exposes shared parsing and TOTP generation helpers**: saved-code management and quick-code UI reuse the same secret parsing, deduplication, history migration, refresh timer, and code generation behavior.

### Added
- **Codex Local API Service can now choose its upstream proxy mode**: API Service settings can switch between following the app's global proxy and connecting directly to the official upstream, with the selected mode persisted for gateway requests.
- **Codex OAuth authorization now has an inline 2FA quick-code picker**: the add-account dialog can show saved MFA secrets, refresh countdowns, and one-click code copying, and reauthorization opens with the target email shown and copyable.

### Fixed
- **Antigravity IDE automatic detection now handles the renamed official install locations**: default app and Language Server resolution covers `/Applications/Antigravity IDE.app`, Windows `Antigravity IDE.exe`, and Linux `antigravity-ide`, including migration away from legacy macOS paths.
- **Antigravity Unified State writes now preserve other synced entries**: OAuth token injection replaces only the `oauthTokenInfoSentinelKey` row instead of overwriting the whole topic, so other sentinel rows remain intact.

---
## [0.23.11] - 2026-05-19

### Added
- **Codex Local API Service now supports custom account routing**: API Service collections can choose Custom routing, set per-account priority and weight, batch-edit selected accounts, and persist normalized routing rules for gateway account selection.
- **Codex token import now accepts ChatGPT/Codex session JSON**: imports can read direct or wrapped session JSON containing accessToken/session fields and normalize it into the existing Codex OAuth token flow.

### Changed
- **Codex Local API Service upstream connection failures now show actionable network/proxy diagnostics**: gateway failures now record the 502 failure state and surface clearer guidance for network, proxy, or `chatgpt.com` reachability issues.

---
## [0.23.10] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed
- **Codex CLI now works reliably through the local API service with Cockpit-managed OAuth accounts**: `/v1/responses` requests are normalized for Codex client compatibility before forwarding to the existing upstream pipeline.
- **Codex startup no longer hits a model refresh shape mismatch**: the local `/v1/models` endpoint now serves the Codex client response format when requested by Codex clients.
- **Local Codex API service traffic now bypasses localhost proxy interference**: loopback addresses are merged into `NO_PROXY`/`no_proxy` so local gateway requests stay direct even when a system proxy is configured.

---
## [0.23.9] - 2026-05-17

### Added
- **Codex token import now accepts accessToken-only and common third-party export formats**: Codex imports can read raw JWT access tokens, `accessToken`/`access_token` fields, camelCase token JSON, line-delimited token input, and OpenAI OAuth accounts from common third-party export JSON.
- **macOS menu bar icon style is now configurable**: Settings can switch between the system template status icon and the original color app icon, and the selected style is applied immediately when settings or imported user config change.

### Changed
- **Codex API Key account switching now writes the official runtime provider state**: API Key accounts write the selected provider as a managed `codex_local_access` provider with the bearer token in `config.toml`, preserving the configured provider identity while avoiding stale `openai_base_url` state.
- **Codex OAuth imports now preserve more identity metadata from access tokens**: accessToken-only imports derive email, user ID, plan, account ID, organization ID, and subscription expiry when those claims are available.

### Fixed
- **macOS packaged builds now keep the template menu bar icon visible**: the template tray asset is normalized to menu-bar size before use and the template flag is applied again after tray creation.
- **Codex built-in OpenAI switching now clears managed API Key runtime provider state**: switching back to the built-in path removes Cockpit-managed provider/token entries while preserving unrelated manual providers.
- **Cursor quota badges now use the intended mid-level style for 70%+ usage**: quota indicators no longer use the warning style before reaching the critical range.

---
## [0.23.8] - 2026-05-17

### Added
- **Codex OAuth bindings can now be cleared from the binding dialog**: API Key accounts and the Local API Service expose an explicit unbind action when an OAuth account is already linked.

### Changed
- **Codex API Key accounts and the Local API Service now treat OAuth binding as optional**: unbound entries continue to run through their original API Key flow, while bound entries keep using the selected OAuth login state with the configured provider.
- **Codex OAuth binding copy now matches the optional behavior**: the binding dialog explains the unbound and bound runtime paths instead of presenting OAuth binding as required.

---
## [0.23.7] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- **Gemini account switching on Windows can now sync default credentials into WSL**: when switching the default Gemini account, Cockpit can copy `oauth_creds.json` and `google_accounts.json` into WSL `~/.gemini` and clean stale `gemini-credentials.json`.
- **Modal keyboard/back interactions were expanded across account and tool dialogs**: major dialogs now support `Esc` close and explicit back actions to improve keyboard and layered-modal workflows.

### Changed
- **Gemini WSL sync now has a user-facing toggle in both Settings and Quick Settings**: the new `Sync WSL Configuration` option is enabled by default and controls whether switch-time credential sync is applied.
- **Codex OAuth-binding account picker now uses the same subscription badge style as the main account view**: plan badges in the binding modal follow the same visual classes and plan color semantics as Codex account cards/tables.
- **Homebrew Cask metadata has been updated after v0.23.6**: cask version/checksum references were refreshed to match the latest packaged artifact state.

### Fixed
- **GitHub Copilot switching/import now supports VS Code shared storage on Windows**: account import and token injection now read/write both legacy `User/globalStorage/state.vscdb` and shared `.vscode-shared*/sharedStorage/state.vscdb`, with shared-storage-first lookup and legacy fallback for mixed installs.

---
## [0.23.6] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- **Codex API Key accounts and the Local API Service can now bind an OAuth account**: API-key based Codex usage keeps the selected OAuth account as the login identity while the API Key account or Local API Service provides the runtime provider.
- **Codex OAuth binding now has a searchable account picker**: the binding dialog supports search, plan/status filters, tag filters, sorting, pagination, and compact single-select rows for faster account lookup.

### Changed
- **Codex Local API Service now requires an OAuth binding before launch/test calls**: service activation and health checks use the bound OAuth login state together with the Local API Service provider settings.
- **Codex account overview now shows OAuth binding inline for API Key and Local API Service entries**: binding status is visible from the account card, and the Local API Service preview keeps two member accounts visible.
- **Codex OAuth binding dialog has been redesigned**: the dialog uses a more compact layout, an internal account-list scroll area, and a layered blue/teal visual treatment so the save action remains visible.

---
## [0.23.5] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- **Codex Local API Service now has a real CLI health check with actionable diagnostics**: the API Service dialog can send a real Codex CLI request through the local gateway, then show the tested model, latency, returned output, and the exact failure stage when something breaks.
- **Codex Local API Service access scope is now configurable**: new API Service collections start as local-only, and users can explicitly switch the listener between Local Only and LAN access from the service dialog.

### Changed
- **Codex Local API Service status now describes what users can actually access**: the account card and API Service dialog show the selected access scope instead of a fixed Local/LAN label.
- **Codex external imports now preserve API endpoint settings for Cockpit API accounts**: supported import links can carry an API Base URL so imported Codex API-key accounts are ready to use with the expected provider settings.
- **Antigravity floating cards now show more quota context**: Antigravity account popovers can display up to three quota items instead of two.

### Fixed
- **Codex Local API Service now releases its port before applying app updates**: update restarts stop the in-process gateway before installing or relaunching, wait for the original port to become bindable, and show an in-dialog error if the service cannot be stopped.
- **Codex account switching now keeps local sessions visible after provider changes**: switching between normal Codex accounts and API Service mode repairs affected local history visibility when the underlying provider changes.
- **Kiro account imports no longer merge distinct accounts that only share an AWS profile ARN**: account matching now ignores ARN values as user IDs and deduplicates by real user identity, email, or refresh token.

---
## [0.23.4] - 2026-05-14

### Added
- **Codex Local API Service now exposes a LAN URL when available**: the account overview and API Service dialog can switch between the local URL and detected private LAN address, and copy the selected address for use from other devices on the same network.

### Changed
- **Codex Local API Service upstream requests now follow the app's global proxy settings**: the gateway rebuilds its upstream HTTP client when proxy settings change, honors `no_proxy`, and supports SOCKS proxy URLs.

### Fixed
- **Codex API Key provider state now matches non-OAuth local gateway behavior**: API Key providers are written without OpenAI-auth or websocket requirements, and switching back to built-in OpenAI removes managed API-key provider blocks while preserving unrelated manual providers.
- **Codex session visibility repair now restores more hidden local threads**: SQLite repair now marks threads with a first user message as user-visible, fills missing `thread_source`, and keeps provider-only database schemas working.

---
## [0.23.3] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- **Codex official app speed can now follow accounts, the Local API Service, and managed instances**: account cards/tables, the API Service card, and Codex instance rows/forms can choose Standard or Fast, persist the selected launch speed, and write the official global state before account switches, API Service activation, and managed app launches.

### Changed
- **Codex default app launches now prepare the real launch state before restart**: managed launches can auto-detect the Codex app path when it is missing, close the default Codex process by home/process scan instead of relying only on the saved PID, and write the selected speed before starting Codex.
- **macOS Dock and menu bar reopening now use the shared main-window recovery path**: reopening restores, unhides, activates, and focuses the main window through the same backend routine.

### Fixed
- **Windows source builds no longer fail when the previous debug executable is still running**: Tauri dev/build now clears the stale `target\debug\cockpit_tools.exe` process before Cargo replaces the debug binary.

---
## [0.23.2] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- **Codex instances now support Windows launch and process detection**: Windows can resolve Codex paths, identify managed instance processes by app user-data directory, and open Codex CLI sessions through PowerShell, Windows Terminal, or cmd.
- **Codex session management can copy selected sessions into a target instance**: selected sessions can be restored into one Codex instance, existing session IDs are skipped, target files are backed up, and running targets are called out when a restart may be needed.

### Fixed
- **Codex API Key sessions no longer disappear when switching between different API providers**: API Key accounts now write a single runtime provider into `config.toml` with the selected base URL and Responses wire API, and built-in OAuth switching removes that runtime provider state.
- **WebKit LocalStorage WAL files no longer grow without a startup checkpoint on macOS**: the app now checkpoints WebKit LocalStorage SQLite databases in the background on startup to prevent large WAL files from accumulating over time.

---
## [0.23.1] - 2026-05-12

### Changed
- **Republished from the mainline state to replace the withdrawn v0.23.0 build**: this release keeps the stable v0.22.22 code path and excludes the experimental PR integration that was accidentally published as v0.23.0.

---
## [0.22.22] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- **Codex model-provider management now supports new provider presets**: the account and model-provider flows can recognize and manage the newly added provider options for API-key based Codex usage.

### Removed
- **CodeBuddy CN daily check-in has been removed**: the account-page check-in entry, check-in dialog, instance-page check-in badge, frontend service calls, and desktop commands have been removed from the CodeBuddy CN path.

---
## [0.22.21] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- **Official Linux release artifacts are back in the release pipeline**: CI builds Ubuntu x86_64 and ARM64 targets, publishes AppImage/deb/rpm updater metadata, and README install guidance lists Linux packages again.
- **Codex accounts now support standalone account notes**: account notes can be saved manually from the account overview and are stored with each Codex account record.

### Changed
- **Codex quota refresh network failures are now presented as retryable refresh notices**: request-send failures show a lighter refresh-failed badge and manual retry copy instead of implying a full quota or authorization error.
- **Codex account cards and tables now expose note editing inline**: accounts with API Service membership show the note action beside the service badge, while every account also has a note action in its row/card controls.

### Fixed
- **Codex Local API Service now handles upstream `response.done` SSE completion events**: chat, image, and Responses adapters can read named SSE events, capture usage including cached tokens, and convert completed responses when upstream omits the `type` field in the data payload.
- **Streaming `/v1/responses` requests now stay passthrough**: stream requests keep their upstream streaming adapter instead of being converted through the non-streaming response parser.

---
## [0.22.20] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- **Windsurf account management now supports the Devin Auth account system introduced for new 2026-04+ accounts**: email/password login, `auth1_` token import, refresh, and instance switching can use the Devin auth1 → session → one-time token → IDE token flow, while preserving Devin account/org IDs and user-status data needed by the IDE.
- **Windsurf accounts now default to a recommended sort**: the account overview adds a Recommended sort option that scores accounts from saved daily/weekly quota, reset timing, and plan-cycle timing so accounts with more useful remaining capacity surface first.
- **Backup Manager now produces and exports platform-aware archives**: scheduled/manual backups keep the restorable JSON file and a matching ZIP archive, show platform account counts, support platform filtering, and can download the full JSON, the ZIP, or one platform's JSON.
- **Codex Local API Service now shows its quota pool on the account overview**: the API Service card summarizes member accounts by subscription tier with separate 5-hour and weekly quota totals, and exposes a full quota-pool dialog when there are more tiers to inspect.

### Changed
- **Codex account loading now accepts more portable managed-account files**: token/API-key detail files with portable JSON shapes can be recovered into the current account model, including API provider metadata, timestamps, account IDs, organization IDs, and subscription/plan fields.
- **Codex account overview now treats the Local API Service as the current entry when it is active**: the current marker moves from the underlying account to the API Service card on this page, while the rest of the app keeps its existing current-account logic.
- **Codex Local API Service cards now align with regular account cards**: the card keeps the same action-bar rhythm and hover styling as normal accounts while keeping member previews and quota-pool stats stacked in the body.
- **Codex instance account selection now identifies API Key providers**: API Key accounts show their provider inline in instance quota previews and can be searched by provider name.
- **File writes for account/config state now use a shared synced atomic path**: account indexes, OAuth pending state, `config.toml`, group/sync settings, OpenCode/OpenClaw auth files, and backup files write through temp-file replacement with validated backup restore behavior.
- **Quota and token refreshes now use the primary refresh path directly**: provider refresh flows no longer wait on a hidden delayed retry before surfacing the actual failure.
- **Homebrew Cask metadata has been caught up with the v0.22.19 release artifact**: the cask version and checksum now point to the 0.22.19 universal DMG.

### Fixed
- **Windsurf Devin accounts switch into instances with fresher IDE credentials**: instance launch pre-refreshes Devin accounts, writes stable installation/onboarding/sign-in/user fields, and includes Devin account/org/protobuf status data to avoid launch-time signed-out or permission-denied states.
- **Account lists no longer disappear when storage temporarily returns an unexpected empty result**: shared account stores keep the current cached accounts/current account during abnormal empty reads, while still allowing real empty results after intentional deletion.
- **Backup restore and retention now handle JSON/ZIP pairs consistently**: backup reads can fall back from a damaged or missing JSON file to its archive, and cleanup removes expired JSON and ZIP backups together.

---
## [0.22.19] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- **Codex external account-import links now support remote import bundles**: the `import_url` deep-link parameter can fetch an HTTP/HTTPS JSON import bundle, import accounts one by one, and show a dedicated progress dialog with totals, success/failure counts, and copyable failed items.

### Changed
- **Codex account imports now refresh OAuth quota data in the backend**: local, JSON, and file imports refresh imported OAuth accounts after saving, skip API Key accounts, then update account and tray state from the refreshed records.
- **Codex import bundles now accept more portable JSON shapes**: remote and pasted JSON imports can read root arrays, nested string payloads, direct Codex token objects, and JSON Lines with one account object per line.
- **Codex portable export output now normalizes Cockpit Tools JSON**: Cockpit Tools exports produce portable token/API-key JSON, while CPA documents preserve token refresh and expiry metadata.
- **Codex PRO plan handling now aligns bare `pro` accounts with CPA 20x semantics**: accounts without an explicit `prolite` marker are shown as PRO Max/20x and ranked as the 20x tier by Local API Service routing.
- **Codex session-visibility repair now keeps only the latest repair backup per instance**: old session-visibility repair backup directories are pruned before running a new repair to avoid long-term backup buildup.

### Fixed
- **Codex OAuth imports no longer fail when email only exists in the OpenAI profile claim**: `id_token` parsing now reads `https://api.openai.com/profile.email` when the top-level email claim is absent.
- **External import links now honor automatic token import requests**: token/payload links with `auto_import=true` submit automatically, and repeated delivery of the same import request within a short window is ignored.

---
## [0.22.18] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- **Codex Local API Service now supports the official image-generation API path**: the local gateway exposes `gpt-image-2`, accepts `/v1/images/generations` and `/v1/images/edits`, maps image requests to Codex Responses `image_generation`, and injects the image-generation tool into regular Responses/chat sessions so Codex's official imagegen skill can use the same local API service.

### Changed
- **Codex API/account switching now repairs session visibility automatically**: switches between OAuth accounts, API Key accounts, and the local API Service show the detected source and target credential types, run visibility repair in the dialog automatically, and show the repair result without requiring a separate manual repair click.
- **Codex quota refresh errors now avoid implying account damage**: transient quota refresh failures now say that the latest quota could not be fetched and the account status is unaffected.

### Fixed
- **Codex session visibility repair and sync no longer fail on invalid state databases**: unreadable, corrupted, or incomplete `state_5.sqlite` files are skipped with a clear repair summary, while valid rollout and SQLite records continue to be repaired or synchronized.

---
## [0.22.17] - 2026-04-30

### Changed
- **Codex API/account switching now keeps account changes and session-visibility repair separate**: switching between OAuth accounts, API Key accounts, and the local API Service now completes the real account change first, then shows a post-switch “Codex Sessions Hidden” dialog with an explicit Repair Visibility action, in-dialog repair results, and a “don’t show again” option.

### Fixed
- **Codex API Service activation no longer shows the session-visibility dialog after cancellation**: canceling the API Service risk notice stops the activation flow without showing the post-switch repair guidance.
- **Codex account switching no longer auto-runs history visibility repair in the backend**: normal account switching no longer waits on rollout/SQLite repair work, avoiding stuck processing states when users only want to switch accounts.

---
## [0.22.16] - 2026-04-30

### Changed
- **Codex OAuth token management now uses a guarded official-client refresh path**: refresh requests use the official JSON payload with connector scopes, account refresh reloads newer official Keychain/auth snapshots for the same account before rotating tokens, and TokenKeeper performs an 8-day guarded keepalive so refreshed token chains are written through before stale `refresh_token` values are reused.
- **WorkBuddy account switching now writes the shared client auth file directly**: switch, inject, and local import flows use `CodeBuddyExtension/Data/Public/auth/workbuddy-desktop.info` instead of VS Code `state.vscdb` secret injection, matching the current desktop client storage shape without requiring a prior Keychain-backed secret store.
- **GitHub Copilot account presentation now distinguishes PRO+ premium entitlement**: plan badges, filters, dashboard cards, floating cards, instance badges, and quota presentation recognize PRO+ and show premium request usage as used/total when exact counters are available.
- **Trae OAuth login now normalizes app version and product detection**: login context discovery accepts app directories and executable paths, and auth requests now use a minimum supported app version of `3.5.54` instead of falling back to stale plugin/version fields.
- **Codex account overview now supports custom account ordering and safer API-mode switching**: users can persist a custom display order, and switching from OAuth to API Key/API Service shows a session-visibility notice with an optional one-time repair action.

### Fixed
- **Codex auth failures now explain the real refresh-token failure mode**: reused, expired, revoked, invalid, or missing refresh tokens ask the user to log in again, while `unsupported_country_region_territory` tells the user to change network region without marking the account as permanently requiring reauthorization.
- **Instance auto-refresh no longer interrupts active instance menus or modals**: background refresh pauses while inline menus or instance dialogs are open.

### Removed
- **Official Linux/Ubuntu release support has been removed**: release workflows no longer build Ubuntu packages, updater metadata no longer requires Linux AppImage/deb/rpm assets, and official documentation now lists macOS and Windows as the supported desktop platforms.

---
## [0.22.15] - 2026-04-29

### Changed
- **Codex Local API Service now listens on local and LAN interfaces**: the gateway binds to all IPv4 interfaces while keeping the app's own base URL on `127.0.0.1`, so LAN clients can connect through the host machine's LAN IP without a separate Windows `portproxy` rule.
- **Codex Local API Service now accepts larger Codex client payloads**: the request read limit increases from 8 MB to 32 MB to accommodate larger code-context requests before they are forwarded upstream.
- **Codex API Key account handling is now save-only from the add-account modal**: API Key imports refresh the account list after saving, remove the separate add-and-switch action, and show empty quota/subscription states instead of linking out to OpenAI usage.
- **Codex plan detection now recognizes current PRO tier aliases**: `pro-5x` and `codex-pro-5x` map to PRO Lite, while `pro-20x` and `codex-pro-20x` map to PRO Max.

---
## [0.22.14] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- **Codex Local API Service routing can now prioritize accounts whose subscriptions expire sooner**: account pool routing adds an `Expiry Soon First` strategy that reads saved subscription expiry metadata and then falls back to plan tier and remaining quota ordering.

### Changed
- **Codex account overview no longer keeps a separate subscription-expiry filter**: the accounts page removes the expiry filter control and clears its persisted filter state while keeping subscription metadata available in account details.
- **Codex Plus accounts now use a distinct badge treatment**: account lists, Local API Service member views, dashboard cards, floating cards, and instance badges can style Plus separately from other plan badges.

---
## [0.22.13] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- **Codex quota refresh no longer forces OAuth token rotation only because `id_token` expired**: quota refresh again uses the `access_token` validity and only refreshes tokens when the access token is expired or the quota API reports token invalidation, avoiding unnecessary refreshes that could lead to 401 responses.

### Changed
- **Codex subscription metadata now uses neutral missing-information wording**: subscription columns, filters, cards, and tooltips now say subscription info or term, and missing subscription metadata is shown as unavailable instead of asking the user to reauthorize.
- **Codex PRO Lite and PRO Max accounts now keep PRO filtering while using distinct badges**: account lists, local API access, dashboard cards, floating cards, and instance badges can style `pro_lite` and `pro_max` separately without moving them out of the PRO filter group.

---
## [0.22.12] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- **Codex Local API Service port conflicts are now recoverable in-app**: gateway restart stops the previous listener before rebinding, occupied-port failures show a clear cleanup action, and the configured local port can be cleared before restarting the service.

### Added
- **Codex account lists now surface subscription expiry**: OAuth accounts persist `chatgpt_subscription_active_until`, display expiry state in compact, card, and table views, support expiry filtering/sorting, and include subscription expiry metadata in compatible third-party exports.
- **GitHub Copilot accounts can now import the current local VS Code session**: the import modal can read VS Code's selected Copilot GitHub login and matching GitHub auth session, validate it through official GitHub/Copilot APIs, and save it as a managed account.

---
## [0.22.11] - 2026-04-26

### Changed
- **Codex token management now uses Cockpit's account store as the single authority**: managed Codex workflows no longer auto-read unmanaged official `auth.json` or Keychain snapshots back into Cockpit before injection, preventing stale local credentials from overwriting refreshed account-center tokens.
- **Codex managed CLI runs now preserve rotated refresh tokens more reliably**: account-scoped execution serializes token refresh, projection writes, official CLI execution, and post-run token sync from Cockpit-marked managed homes so a rotated `refresh_token` chain is written back before another managed consumer can reuse the old value.
- **Codex API Key handling now masks secrets by default**: API Key account cards and credential inputs hide keys unless explicitly revealed, and reveal state resets when switching accounts or managed provider keys.
- **Dashboard current-account cards now stay populated for account-management-only users**: when a platform has managed accounts but no resolved current account, the dashboard shows the first account from the account data instead of an empty current-account slot.
- **Original sidebar layout now supports up to three platform entries**: Platform Layout can select up to three sidebar entries in the original layout, and the sidebar shows all three before moving remaining platforms under More Platforms.

### Added
- **Dashboard platform cards now include a quick hide action**: platform cards can be hidden directly from the dashboard while using the same dashboard visibility setting managed by Platform Layout.
- **Codex model preset management is easier to reach from provider configuration**: the Codex model provider manager can open the preset editor directly, reducing the steps needed to maintain wake-up model presets.

### Fixed
- **Windows tray menu refresh no longer deadlocks after runtime updates**: tray rebuilds no longer wrap Tauri menu construction in an extra main-thread dispatch, so background account, quota, or layout refreshes keep menu clicks, navigation, and window restore actions responsive.

---
## [0.22.10] - 2026-04-24

### Changed
- **Windsurf Auth1 account injection now matches official client token semantics**: Auth1 flows now keep `devin-session-token$...` as the primary access token for local session writes, inject `sessionToken` / `authMethod=auth1` into local auth status when available, and stop relying on the extra synthetic-API-key recovery request.
- **Windsurf launch now defaults to window reuse instead of forcing a new window**: default start commands no longer force `open -n`; instance and default launches follow normal app reuse behavior.
- **Codex JSON export now supports CPA multi-document workflows in one modal**: CPA exports can render per-account cards, save each account JSON separately, or batch-download all generated files into a chosen directory.

### Fixed
- **Export failures are now surfaced inside the active export modal**: copy/save/open-directory failures now appear in-modal with anchored error messaging, and stale error states are cleared when retrying, toggling preview state, switching format, or closing the modal.
- **Windsurf extension state now writes compatible pending migration tokens for supported prefixes**: supported tokens (`sk-ws-01-`, `devin-session-token$`, `cog_`) are written into `windsurf.pendingApiKeyMigration`, preventing repeated migration loops after startup.

---
## [0.22.9] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **Windsurf account login/import now supports Auth1 accounts and Devin Session Tokens**: token import can read `devin-session-token$...`, password login auto-detects Firebase vs Auth1, and Auth1 sessions can recover synthetic API keys plus plan snapshots.
- **Log Viewer now supports switching log files and filtering by level**: the modal can browse managed `app.log` / `codex-api.log` files and filter entries by `INFO` / `WARN` / `ERROR`.

### Changed
- **Codex Local API Service now removes the manual `Speed` selector and follows upstream default tier behavior**: the modal no longer exposes the tier control, request rewriting no longer injects `service_tier`, and the stats range keeps the last selected view.
- **Codex Local API Service streaming and routing are now lighter under account pools**: `/v1/chat/completions` stream responses are transformed chunk-by-chunk instead of full-buffer replay, prepared accounts are cached briefly for routing, and request stats are flushed asynchronously in batches.

### Fixed
- **Codex account injection now uses account-store tokens as the source of truth**: current-account resolution and profile injection stop reading managed local auth snapshots back into the store, preventing stale local state from overriding refreshed credentials.

---
## [0.22.8] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- **Codex Local API Service now supports a `Speed` selector (`Standard` / `Fast`) with persisted defaults**: the account-page API Service modal can save the default tier, and gateway request rewriting now injects `service_tier: "fast"` for `/v1/responses` (including chat-completions translated requests), while standard mode keeps the field unset.
- **Codex switching now supports restarting a user-specified host app after switch/activate**: Settings and Quick Settings add the `Restart specified app when switching Codex` toggle plus path picker/input controls, and backend runtime restarts the configured app path after account switch or API Service activation.

### Changed
- **Local API Service upstream retry now honors retry hints with bounded jitter backoff**: transient `429/5xx/timeout` statuses can retry using `Retry-After` (HTTP header or upstream hint parser) under a total retry budget, instead of fixed single-account status retries.

---
## [0.22.7] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- **Codex API Service now exposes an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` entry that is translated to the official Responses protocol internally**: model snapshot aliases, tools/tool_choice, response_format, and streaming tool-call deltas are normalized in both directions so third-party clients can call the local gateway directly.
- **Codex API Service management now shows `API Port URL` and selectable `Model ID` values**: the modal supports one-click copy and reads model options from backend runtime state.
- **Desktop startup now includes an `AppRuntimeGuard` fallback layer**: render crashes and chunk-load failures show an in-app error panel with details and a refresh action.

### Changed
- **Codex API Service upstream dispatch now retries transient failures more predictably**: request-send errors and single-account transient 5xx/timeout statuses now use bounded backoff retries, while 429 usage-limit responses continue to honor model-level cooldown.
- **Trae refresh flow now protects accounts bound to running clients/instances**: manual refresh, batch refresh, and token keeper switch to usage-only refresh for protected accounts, while still updating quota/usage snapshots.
- **Trae switch/start flow now uses stricter pre/post account validation**: account is refreshed before inject/start, post-start performs strict check-login with silent remediation when needed, and switch now aborts if existing Trae process cannot be closed cleanly.
- **Codex account switching now always runs session-visibility repair checks**: provider changes are explicitly logged while non-provider changes still run consistency checks.

---
## [0.22.6] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **External provider import now handles deep-link wakeups across startup and runtime paths**: startup arguments, single-instance wakeups, `deep_link.on_open_url` / `get_current`, and macOS `RunEvent::Opened` now all route through the same import handler with pending payload delivery.
- **Codex API Service member management now includes a persisted `Limit Free Accounts` toggle**: collection settings add `restrictFreeAccounts` (default `true`), so Free-plan accounts can be explicitly allowed when needed.

### Changed
- **Codex API Service account filtering now follows the persisted Free-account restriction end-to-end**: save flow, runtime collection sanitization, and request proxy candidate filtering now use the same rule instead of always hard-blocking Free plans.
- **Antigravity external-import token handling now auto-normalizes raw OAuth refresh tokens before opening the add-account modal**: `1//...` payloads are automatically wrapped into JSON (`{"refresh_token":"..."}`) to reduce manual token conversion.

---
## [0.22.5] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **Trae account upsert now uses `user_id` as the primary identity key and falls back to email only when needed**: imports no longer merge different users just because emails match, and placeholder `unknown` email values are excluded from identity matching.
- **Cursor plan badge normalization now maps `pro_student` to `pro`**: student Pro subscriptions now render the expected Pro badge instead of exposing raw membership text.

### Added
- **Codex API Service switch now prompts to enable the service when it is currently disabled**: the account-page action shows a warning modal and supports one-click `Enable and Switch` before proceeding.

### Changed
- **Gemini default-instance settings now persist `working_dir` end-to-end**: list/update/start/stop flows all read and return the saved working directory instead of forcing it to empty.
- **API Service activation paths no longer auto-run session visibility repair**: switching to service mode now focuses on applying the real profile change, while history-repair remains an explicit operation.

---
## [0.22.4] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- **Settings now include an in-app Release Notes viewer with per-version download actions**: the About section adds a `Release Notes` button, opens changelog history in a modal, and provides direct download actions for each listed version.

### Changed
- **Updater backend now exposes structured release history parsed from bundled changelog files**: the desktop command `get_release_history` reads `CHANGELOG.md` / `CHANGELOG.zh-CN.md`, parses `Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed` sections, and returns locale-aware results with list limits for frontend rendering.
- **Codex Local API Service member eligibility now excludes Free-plan and API Key accounts end-to-end**: backend collection sanitization/request routing and frontend selection/save flows now enforce the same rule, while unsupported accounts are visibly marked and non-selectable.
- **Codex Local API Service default/empty state is now stabilized for first-run and missing-collection scenarios**: runtime auto-seeds a disabled collection when absent, the overview card keeps deterministic base-url/API-key placeholders, and empty-state guidance is rewritten to the new start flow.

---
## [0.22.3] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- **Codex Session Manager now supports per-session Token usage stats on demand**: expanding a session group fetches input/output/total token counts from rollout `token_count` events, shows loading states in-row, and avoids full-file rescans via backend chunked tail parsing plus metadata cache.
- **Codex local API Service actions now show a risk notice before first start/switch**: starting the service or switching into service mode now requires explicit acknowledgement, with an optional local `don't show again` choice.

### Changed
- **Codex quick config now uses unified presets across entry points**: Quick Settings, the Model Providers quick-config modal, and the instance editor all support `Default / 516K / 1M / Custom`, write `model_context_window` and `model_auto_compact_token_limit` directly, and validate both fields as positive integers.
- **Codex instance quick-config now writes to the target instance's real `config.toml`**: backend commands can read/save/open the effective profile path for each instance instead of only targeting the default home.

---
## [0.22.2] - 2026-04-18

### Changed
- **Codex API Service now adds persisted overview controls and time-window stats**: the overview card can be collapsed in list mode, Settings and Quick Settings can hide or restore the entry, hiding the entry also disables the current local service, and the service panel now switches between daily, weekly, and monthly stats.
- **Current-account resolution now follows Cockpit's explicit selection instead of fallback guessing**: provider injections persist the current-account mapping, GitHub Copilot is included in that flow, and account index repair/delete paths no longer silently repoint the current account to the first remaining record.
- **Auto backup retention now defaults to 15 days with a one-time legacy migration**: existing configs using the historical default `3` are upgraded to `15` once, while later user-selected values (including `3`) are preserved and no longer auto-overwritten.

---
## [0.22.1] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Account overview pages now support platform-scoped filter persistence (disabled by default)**: Quick Settings adds a `Remember overview filters (except search)` toggle, and when enabled the app persists per-platform view mode, tag/group filters, and sort preferences.
- **Backend OAuth token keeper is now enabled for long-running desktop sessions**: Cockpit starts a periodic token keepalive worker on app startup and refreshes near-expiry OAuth tokens across supported providers with backoff and tray-state refresh hooks.

### Changed
- **Antigravity auto-switch now supports Credits threshold triggers in addition to quota thresholds**: Settings and Quick Settings add Credits monitoring controls, trigger reasons now include credits context, and candidate ranking now prefers higher quota then higher remaining Credits.
- **Codex API Service card now stays fixed as the first entry card across overview layouts**: the service card no longer gets split into a separate region, empty-state actions now use a centered `Add Account` CTA, and plan badges in the member picker are aligned with account-page badge styling.

---
## [0.22.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Merged upstream workspace/CLI changes from PR #490 (`dcdeda2`, based on `ca5aade`)**: the repository is migrated to a Cargo Workspace, introduces `cockpit-core` as shared Rust logic, and initializes `cockpit-cli` with the first account list/switch flow for Cursor and Gemini.
- **Codex now includes full local API Service management on the account pages**: an inline service card plus a dedicated panel can manage collection members, API key visibility/reset, service port, direct activate/test actions, and account collection edits in one workflow.
- **API Service now records and displays usage metrics for totals and per-account views**: request counts, token usage (input/output/cache/reasoning), average latency, and success rate are all visible in the service panel.

### Changed
- **Integrated Codex account/export adjustments from `5a2d970`**: Codex import now preserves `auth_file_plan_type` (`prolite`/`promax`) from file metadata and uses it in plan badges (`PRO 5x` / `PRO 20x`); compatible third-party export payload now includes `exported_at`, `type/version`, `proxies`, and per-account `concurrency/priority`.
- **Codex instance binding now supports a dedicated API Service target (`__api_service__`)**: account pickers, instance search, and Codex instance labels now recognize and display API Service mode consistently.
- **Starting a Codex instance in API Service mode now applies the switch on the real profile directory**: startup uses the same persisted on-disk path as normal instance switching, and triggers history-visibility repair when the effective provider changes.
- **Activating API Service from Codex accounts now syncs default runtime pointers**: Cockpit clears the default current-account pointer and updates the default Codex instance binding to API Service mode.
- **Cockpit startup now auto-restores saved local API gateway runtime state**: previously enabled API Service settings are resumed without manual reactivation.
- **Codex quota error messaging for network failures is now normalized**: manual-refresh hints no longer expose raw backend error details.
- **New API Service locale keys are now fully synchronized across all supported locales**: `zh-CN`, `en-US`, `en`, and the remaining non-English locale packs all ship with matching keys.

---
## [0.21.4] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **Codex account export now supports Cockpit Tools, a common third-party export format, and CPA formats**: the export dialog can switch formats before preview, copy, or save so Codex credentials can be moved directly into each target tool.
- **Instance account pickers now support tag filtering while binding accounts**: instance dropdowns can search and narrow accounts by tags, making large account pools easier to bind without memorizing email addresses.
- **Account pages now support keyboard refresh shortcuts**: `Cmd/Ctrl + R` and `F5` on Windows trigger the visible page refresh action without clicking the toolbar button.

### Changed
- **Tag-grouped account views now surface the default group first and keep scroll position after saving tags**: newly added untagged accounts are easier to find, and editing tags no longer jumps long lists back to the top.
- **Codex and GitHub Copilot table layouts are refined for large screens**: subscription badges stay on one line, sticky action columns blend with row backgrounds, and 2K-width tables read more cleanly.
- **Floating card startup is now disabled by default for new configs**: fresh installs no longer auto-open the floating card window on launch unless users opt in.

### Fixed
- **GitHub Copilot OAuth account import now always issues a fresh device code for each new attempt**: retrying after a failed authorization no longer reuses an expired 8-digit code or require an app restart.

---
## [0.21.3] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- **Windsurf account onboarding now supports email/password sign-in again, including batch import**: the add-account dialog now supports single-account login plus batch import from JSON arrays or delimiter-based text, and failed rows return explicit line-level error feedback while successful logins immediately sync managed account data.
- **Codex account groups now support in-group quick add, direct removal, and group deletion workflows**: users can enter a group as a scoped view, add more accounts from a picker, remove one or many accounts from that group, and delete the group with in-modal confirmation and error feedback.

### Changed
- **Shared Accounts and Codex account pages now expose faster group-entry actions around folder views**: group cards, table rows, and in-group breadcrumb toolbars now provide direct add-account actions, and moving Codex accounts between groups excludes the current source group to avoid no-op targets.
- **Opening the live Codex `config.toml` now goes through the desktop backend instead of frontend path opening**: Quick Settings and the model-provider quick config card now resolve and open the active file through the Tauri opener command for more reliable desktop behavior.

---
## [0.21.2] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- **Settings now support data backup/import bundles for accounts and app config**: export or import accounts only, config only, or both together; config restore covers groups, instances, wakeup tasks, current-account refresh settings, and Codex model-provider data, while legacy account-only backups remain importable and report when some bindings need remapping or a restart is required.
- **Settings now include a Backup Manager for scheduled local backups**: Cockpit can create one managed backup per day, keep backups in the app data `backups` directory with configurable retention, and let users run a backup immediately or import/delete existing backup files from the same dialog.
- **Codex Session Manager now supports restoring trashed sessions back to their original instances**: restored sessions recover the rollout file, the `session_index.jsonl` entry, and the `state_5.sqlite` thread row together instead of requiring manual file repair.

### Changed
- **Provider account pages now share a unified pagination and filter experience**: page size is configurable per platform, selection and grouping stay consistent across table and grid views, and tag/sort dropdowns auto-flip to remain usable in small windows.
- **Gemini account tables now surface Pro / Flash quota status directly in list view**: quota summaries are visible without switching back to card layout, making remaining capacity easier to scan.
- **Instance account pickers now open in anchored floating menus that stay visible near window edges**: long account lists keep the active option in view, and Trae instance search now also matches display names in addition to email and plan text.
- **Codex account switching now auto-repairs historical session visibility only when the effective provider changes**: after a successful switch, Cockpit compares the provider before and after the change and only then repairs rollout/session metadata together with `state_5.sqlite`.

### Removed
- **Windsurf account onboarding no longer includes email/password login**: the add-account dialog now focuses on OAuth, token, and local JSON import flows.

### Fixed
- **Quota refresh failures now surface explicit warning and empty states across provider account pages**: Cursor, Gemini, GitHub Copilot, Kiro, Qoder, Trae, Windsurf, Zed, and the aggregated Accounts page now persist the last quota-query error, show a visible failure badge/message, and fall back to a clear `No quota data` state instead of silently rendering blank or ambiguous quota panels.
- **Codex account state now stays aligned with the live local OAuth session more reliably**: current-account detection, switch preparation, quota refresh, and wakeup runs reuse newer local auth data and write refreshed tokens back to managed homes, reducing stale-token mismatches.
- **Background auto refresh now runs through a unified scheduler**: quota refresh and current-account refresh jobs across providers are less likely to overlap or double-trigger, improving refresh stability.
- **Trae token refresh now preserves regional auth context when rewriting local auth state**: refreshed sessions keep the host, region, and refresh-expiry metadata needed for follow-up injection flows.

---
## [0.21.1] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Codex instances now support choosing Desktop vs CLI launch mode per instance**: CLI mode can persist a working directory, shows launch-mode state in the instance list, and after switching an instance it can prepare a runnable command for copy or direct terminal execution on macOS.
- **Codex Model Providers now include quick controls for the active `~/.codex/config.toml`**: the manager can toggle `model_context_window = 1000000`, manage `model_auto_compact_token_limit`, open the live config file, and show a write preview before saving provider changes.

### Changed
- **Codex API-key accounts now persist provider identity together with the Base URL and sync matching `model_provider` / `model_providers` entries into `config.toml`**: managed-provider selection and API-key credential updates now stay aligned with the actual Codex runtime provider config.
- **Gemini launch dialogs now support choosing the target terminal before direct execution**: launch-command popups for default and instance Gemini CLI flows can copy the command or run it in the selected supported terminal instead of only relying on the saved default terminal.

---
## [0.21.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Codex now includes a dedicated Model Providers workspace for API-key accounts**: manage compatible providers and multiple API keys in one place, reuse them while adding or editing API-key accounts, and quick-switch existing API-key accounts to a saved provider/key pair directly from the account page.
- **Bahasa Indonesia is now available as a supported UI language**: the locale registry, settings language picker, and documentation language list now include Indonesian.

### Changed
- **Gemini CLI launch now supports a configurable default terminal plus direct in-terminal execution from the launch dialog**: users can choose the preferred terminal in Settings, then copy the launch command or run it directly from the dialog after switching an instance.
- **Codex Session Manager now adds one-click historical visibility repair across instances**: it repairs rollout files and `state_5.sqlite` provider metadata from each instance's root `config.toml` `model_provider`, and creates backups before writing.
- **Windows desktop WebSocket access now allows WSL-side clients through a detected local-network whitelist**: Cockpit can now accept local plugin/runtime connections coming from WSL bridge networks instead of loopback only.

### Fixed
- **Local account persistence now uses atomic writes with backup-assisted recovery across providers**: account index/detail JSON writes create backups first and can auto-restore from `.bak` files when a recoverable parse failure is detected, reducing local data corruption risk.

---
## [0.20.19] - 2026-04-07

### Changed
- **All platforms now support a dedicated current-account refresh interval with matching Quick Settings entry points (default: 1 minute)**: each platform can tune current-account refresh cadence independently without changing that platform's full quota auto-refresh interval.
- **Wakeup tasks now support an `After startup` trigger with optional delay for both Antigravity and Codex**: enabled startup tasks are dispatched automatically after app launch, while regular scheduler loops skip startup-only tasks.
- **Codex wakeup runtime setup now supports explicit `codex` / `node` path configuration with required-path hints**: when auto-detection fails, users can provide executable or directory paths in the runtime guide and recheck/apply immediately.
- **Auto-switch scope now supports selecting specific accounts (not only model groups)**: Antigravity and Codex can now limit auto-switch monitoring and candidate selection to selected account IDs from Settings and Quick Settings.
- **System settings now include app auto-launch control with native autostart sync**: desktop config now reads and applies real OS autostart status through the autostart plugin instead of frontend-only state.

### Fixed
- **Codex account import now fails fast on disk-full conditions with clear progress feedback**: import now performs a writable precheck and returns explicit disk-space errors instead of partial silent failures.
- **Instance directory deletion now consistently moves directories to recycle/trash across platforms**: deletion now uses unified trash semantics instead of mixed platform-specific removal paths.

---
## [0.20.18] - 2026-04-04

### Changed
- **Codex CLI detection now scans common user-level install paths in the home directory**: runtime lookup now includes `~/.npm-global/bin`, `~/.local/bin`, `~/.cargo/bin`, `~/.volta/bin`, `~/.yarn/bin`, and `~/bin`, improving detection reliability for non-system installs.
- **Wakeup scheduling now aligns crontab/interval previews with actual runtime rules**: both desktop and frontend now validate full 5-field crontab syntax (including ranges, steps, list values, and weekday normalization), interval windows support overnight ranges, and quota-reset tasks can use fallback trigger times outside the configured time window.
- **Gemini token sync now prioritizes keychain credentials and enforces project-aware quota refresh**: local credential loading merges macOS keychain and file data, account switching writes tokens back to keychain while cleaning legacy file-keychain artifacts, and quota requests now require and pass the resolved project id consistently.
- **Antigravity quota refresh now distinguishes manual-batch vs automatic refresh triggers**: auto refresh continues skipping disabled/forbidden accounts, while manual batch refresh keeps full-account processing behavior.

---
## [0.20.17] - 2026-04-01

### Changed
- **Antigravity auto-switch now supports model-group scope selection (`any_group` / `selected_groups`) and group-level threshold evaluation**: quick settings can target specific display groups, config now persists selected group IDs, and candidate selection follows monitored-group thresholds.
- **Codex shared-resource link sync now force-rebuilds mismatched instance links instead of blocking with manual-merge errors**: when shared directories/files diverge from global defaults, stale instance targets are removed and recreated as symlinks automatically.

### Fixed
- **Antigravity account switch failure now rehydrates current-account state before returning errors**: the account store refetches account lists/current account and emits account-change events only when the effective current account actually changes, preventing stale UI state after failed switches.

---
## [0.20.16] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Gemini accounts now support per-account GCP project selection from live cloud projects**: account cards/tables now provide a project settings dialog that lists accessible projects, supports switching back to automatic project resolution, and persists the selected project id.
- **Codex instances now auto-link shared Skills/Rules/AGENTS resources during create/start flows**: `skills`, `rules`, `vendor_imports/skills`, and `AGENTS.md` are synchronized against default Codex Home with migration and conflict guards.

### Changed
- **Gemini quota refresh and CLI launch now prefer the configured project id when available**: project selection is refreshed after save, project id is shown in account rows/cards, and launch commands inject `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`.
- **Current-account-first ordering is now unified across account pages and instance pickers**: active current accounts are promoted before other sort keys in Antigravity, Codex, Gemini, Cursor, Windsurf, Kiro, Qoder, Trae, Zed, GitHub Copilot, CodeBuddy CN, and WorkBuddy views.
- **OpenCode switch-related defaults are now disabled by default**: `sync_on_switch` and `auth_overwrite_on_switch` now default to off in config loading, settings initialization, and wakeup task context.
- **Codex code-review quota visibility now defaults to hidden**: local preference now requires explicit opt-in to show this metric.
- **Updater dependency graph now includes reqwest socks capability for the updater path**: improves compatibility when global proxy is configured as `socks5://`.

---
## [0.20.15] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- **A dedicated 2FA Manager page is now available in Classic sidebar navigation**: users can query Base32 secrets, view rolling OTP codes, save favorites, review recent history, and import/export saved records as JSON from one workspace.

### Changed
- **Codex multi-account local storage is now unified under `~/.antigravity_cockpit` with one-time migration from legacy paths**: existing `codex_accounts.json` and account detail files are copied to the new directory without overwriting newer files.
- **Grid-view batch selection is now consistent across account pages**: `Select All` is now shown in grid mode for platform account pages and shared suite views, including grouped-by-tag rendering.
- **2FA page labels and actions are now fully wired to i18n keys across locales**: navigation labels, confirmations, table headers, and action text no longer rely on hard-coded UI strings.
- **The log viewer modal footer now includes an explicit close action**: users can dismiss the dialog directly from the footer without relying on header controls.

---
## [0.20.14] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **CodeBuddy CN and WorkBuddy now share one account workspace and check-in flow with synchronized capabilities**: both platforms now use the same account list/table rendering, check-in modal interactions, and parsing/normalization pipeline so account actions and quota display behavior stay consistent.
- **CodeBuddy CN now supports daily check-in end-to-end**: the account page and desktop command layer now include check-in API integration, status presentation, and in-context check-in dialog interactions.

### Changed
- **CodeBuddy CN quota presentation now uses a four-category model with unified aggregation logic**: quota data is reorganized into `base`, `activity`, `extra`, and `other` groups, and shared suite models now drive account-page and dashboard totals consistently.
- **Settings now complete CodeBuddy CN and WorkBuddy refresh controls in one loop**: quick settings and settings page now expose aligned refresh options for both platforms and reuse shared auto-refresh wiring.
- **Cloud Code quota requests now build metadata and User-Agent from detected official Antigravity installation details**: local quota fetching and onboarding now derive IDE version, platform, and client headers dynamically (including `x-goog-api-client`) instead of relying on hard-coded version/header values.

### Fixed
- **CodeBuddy instances and dashboard cards now resolve account type and quota aggregation more accurately**: instance rows now follow shared account-type mapping and dashboard cards no longer mix incorrect aggregates across providers.
- **Check-in i18n keys are now fully aligned across locales (including ar and zh-tw)**: missing keys are added and duplicated English fallbacks are removed to keep localized check-in UI complete.

---
## [0.20.13] - 2026-03-28

### Changed
- **Antigravity wakeup now aligns official Language Server startup flags by selected client version mode**: Wakeup Tasks and Account Verification now expose an `>=1.21.6 / <1.21.6` selector, the selection is persisted locally and synchronized to desktop runtime, and the wakeup gateway now appends `--random_port` only for `<1.21.6` mode to match older official client behavior.
- **Wakeup account pickers now support combined search + type/tag/group filtering with visible-scope batch selection**: task editing, manual tests, and account verification can all filter by account type, tags, and groups (including ungrouped), while “select all” now operates on the currently filtered result set.
- **Codex API Key credential input now validates field intent before save/import**: API Key values that look like URLs are rejected, Base URL must be a valid HTTP(S) URL, and duplicate API Key/Base URL values are blocked to prevent swapped-input mistakes.
- **Codex missing-path dialogs now support disabling launch-on-switch directly in place**: users can keep account switching/login-overwrite behavior while turning off automatic Codex app launch, and once disabled the missing-path prompt will no longer keep reappearing.

---
## [0.20.12] - 2026-03-27

### Changed
- **macOS tray interactions now align left-click and right-click behavior with native expectations while clearing stale menu highlight state**: left-click release now focuses and restores the main window, right-click press opens the tray context menu, and native menu teardown explicitly clears status-item highlight to avoid a stuck highlighted icon.
- **Antigravity account store persistence now keeps only minimal account snapshots and recovers gracefully when localStorage quota is exceeded**: persisted token fields are sanitized, quota snapshots exclude heavy model payloads, and quota overflow now auto-cleans legacy/new cache keys instead of repeatedly failing writes.

---
## [0.20.11] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Codex now includes a dedicated Session Manager for multi-instance thread sync and trash cleanup (thanks @GiZGY, PR #324)**: users can sync missing session threads across instances from one place and move selected sessions to Trash with per-session visibility and grouped workspace context.
- **Codex wakeup manual tests can now be cancelled while running**: test runs now carry a cancellation scope, the desktop wakeup execution can terminate in-flight Codex CLI processes, and the execution-results dialog supports explicit in-run cancellation.

### Changed
- **Homebrew cask metadata has been refreshed to keep packaged distribution in sync with the latest release assets**: the cask formula has been aligned with the current published binaries and checksums.

---
## [0.20.10] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Antigravity wakeup manual tests can now be cancelled directly from the active test dialog**: each test run now carries a cancellation scope through the desktop wakeup pipeline, so cancelling stops in-flight wakeup requests cleanly and shows a dedicated cancellation notice instead of waiting for every request to finish.

### Changed
- **Classic sidebar navigation is now flatter and keeps existing layout preferences through a unified local-store migration**: classic mode no longer depends on expandable grouped sections, remaining entries appear directly in `More`, the collapse handle moves with transform-based animation, and legacy sidebar preference keys are migrated into the new persisted store on upgrade.
- **Antigravity account cache persistence is now consolidated into a unified persisted store with legacy-key migration**: cached account lists and current-account snapshots are rehydrated from the new store while older local keys are migrated and cleaned up automatically.

---
## [0.20.9] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **Added a classic sidebar layout mode with full platform navigation, collapsible sidebar width, grouped-entry expansion, and an in-sidebar logs entry**: users can now switch from the compact original rail to a full-height classic navigation shell that supports inline group children and adaptive scaling in constrained window heights.

### Changed
- **Sidebar layout configuration now supports mode-specific behavior across Settings and platform layout management**: Settings now provides an `Original / Classic` layout selector, first-time entry into classic mode syncs sidebar entries from dashboard visibility, and the platform layout modal now allows unlimited sidebar selections in classic mode while keeping the original mode limit.
- **Antigravity account quota display groups are now fixed to built-in model families (Claude / Gemini Pro / Gemini Flash)**: account page rendering now uses predefined display groups directly, and no longer depends on manual group-settings configuration.
- **Documentation now includes Arch Linux AUR installation paths**: README and README.en.md now document both source-built (`cockpit-tools`) and prebuilt (`cockpit-tools-bin`) AUR packages.

---
## [0.20.8] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- **macOS shell-launched proxy environments now remain effective when Cockpit's in-app global proxy is not explicitly enabled**: app startup and config saves now restore the proxy variables inherited at launch instead of clearing them outright, so workflows such as `export http_proxy=... && open -a 'Cockpit Tools'` continue to work unless users intentionally override proxy settings inside the app.

---
## [0.20.7] - 2026-03-24

### Changed
- **Floating account cards now stay synchronized with account imports, deletions, OAuth completions, and current-account switches across windows**: provider pages and account stores now emit shared account-sync events, so floating cards refresh immediately after account management actions instead of waiting for manual reloads or window refocus, while instance-bound floating cards keep their bound account view.
- **Windsurf official quota panels on the account page now render daily and weekly progress bars with separate low and critical warning colors**: quota items that come from Windsurf's official plan snapshot now use the shared quota-progress styling instead of showing percentage text only, making the remaining-risk state easier to scan at a glance.

### Fixed
- **Current-account detection now follows real local state more tightly after sync, deletion, switching, and empty-list transitions**: provider stores clear stale current-account ids when no accounts remain, current-account changes are propagated immediately after sync/delete/switch flows, and instance-bound floating cards no longer blank out just because the platform cannot resolve a separate current account at that moment.
- **Windsurf quota-billed accounts now keep quota mode and convert official remaining-percent fields into used-percent displays consistently across the account page, tray, macOS native menu, and diagnostic report**: quota views now treat `dailyQuotaRemainingPercent` / `weeklyQuotaRemainingPercent` as remaining quota and fall back to exhausted usage when quota billing omits those fields, so quota-backed accounts no longer slip into credit-mode presentation or invert their usage percentage.

---
## [0.20.6] - 2026-03-24

### Changed
- **Codex wakeup account selection now shows primary and secondary quota badges inline**: wakeup account chips display two compact quota indicators beside the masked account context, so users can compare standard quota state before selecting accounts without opening the full account view.

### Fixed
- **Cross-platform desktop Rust builds now keep Codex and Qoder helper modules aligned with target-specific compilation rules**: Codex CLI install hints now compile cleanly on both macOS and non-macOS targets, and Qoder OAuth path utilities are no longer gated behind a Unix-only import.

---
## [0.20.5] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- **Windsurf quota-billed accounts now show the official used-percent values consistently across the account page, tray, macOS native menu, and diagnostic report**: daily and weekly quota usage is now read directly from the upstream usage fields instead of being inverted as if it were remaining percentage, preventing quota progress from being displayed backwards or incorrectly pinned to exhaustion.

---
## [0.20.4] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **Codex wakeup now supports model presets and per-task reasoning-effort selection end-to-end**: wakeup tasks and manual tests can pick a managed model preset plus reasoning effort, execution records now store the model metadata, and wakeup runs pass `model` / `model_reasoning_effort` directly into Codex CLI execution.
- **Codex wakeup scheduling now supports quota-reset triggers with window selection**: tasks can run after `primary_window`, `secondary_window`, or either reset window, and the scheduler computes due and next runs from real account quota reset timestamps.

### Changed
- **Quota-reset wakeup tasks now enforce a fast Codex quota refresh cadence**: when at least one enabled quota-reset task exists, Codex auto refresh is adjusted to every 2 minutes so reset-trigger detection stays timely.
- **Desktop updater now supports reminder opt-out and per-version skip**: settings include an update reminder toggle, users can skip a detected version from the update dialog, skipped versions are ignored by subsequent checks, and the sidebar quick-update entry follows the reminder setting while preserving in-progress or ready states.
- **Account page view mode persistence is now unified across providers, including the new Codex compact view**: Codex overview adds a compact layout mode, and provider pages persist list/grid preferences with platform-scoped local storage keys.
- **Codex wakeup task summaries and execution details now mask displayed account emails**: task cards and execution result rows now hide full email addresses while preserving account context text and selected model metadata.
- **The floating account card window now disables the native window shadow**: the transparent desktop floating-card window is configured without the system shadow layer.

---
## [0.20.3] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- **Desktop update prompts now stay on a single app-controlled check flow instead of being re-checked inside the popup**: startup and manual checks now reuse the same updater result, detected updates are no longer lost because the dialog performs a second `check()`, silent downloads reopen the same dialog in the ready-to-restart state, and the app performs one startup check followed by hourly polling while it remains open.

### Changed
- **Codex wakeup now keeps a managed per-account `CODEX_HOME` instead of creating a temporary profile for every run**: each account now reuses a stable local wakeup home, `auth.json` is rewritten atomically before execution, and wakeup runs no longer create and delete a fresh temporary profile directory on every trigger.
- **Windows process probing now uses a single inline PowerShell path without temporary script fallback**: Windows detection and launch helpers no longer write transient `.ps1` files or invoke `ExecutionPolicy Bypass` as a fallback when inline PowerShell execution fails.

---
## [0.20.2] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- **Bundled macOS Codex wakeup builds now detect Homebrew-installed Codex CLI and its Node runtime without depending on the terminal PATH**: the desktop app now augments packaged GUI detection with standard macOS CLI install directories, resolves the `codex` launcher and required `node` interpreter through the same runtime search path, and prevents released `.app` builds from falsely reporting that Codex CLI is not installed when it is available under `/opt/homebrew` or `/usr/local`.
- **Windows Codex wakeup CLI checks no longer flash a black console window during runtime probing**: Codex CLI version probing and wakeup command launches now apply the hidden-window process flags consistently, so packaged desktop builds no longer briefly open a console window when checking CLI availability or running a wakeup command.

### Changed
- **Codex wakeup CLI probing now writes targeted desktop logs for packaged-app diagnosis**: CLI rechecks, version probing, runtime resolution, and wakeup execution now emit `[CodexWakeup][CLI]` log lines with the resolved search directories, launcher path, Node path, and process failure output so packaged-app environment issues can be diagnosed directly from `app.log`.

---
## [0.20.1] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- **Codex wakeup tasks now include an always-available execution details view**: each task card adds a dedicated details icon that opens the same execution-results dialog used by manual tests, so users can inspect queued accounts before a run starts and keep watching the same panel when a scheduled run begins.

### Fixed
- **Codex wakeup task cards now guard manual runs and count trigger history by task run instead of per-account records**: clicking the manual-run action now requires confirmation before immediately waking accounts, and the history badge reflects grouped task/test executions instead of inflated per-account totals.
- **Release asset publishing now keeps updater bundles in a single GitHub release before merged metadata is rebuilt**: the release workflow now creates one draft release up front and uploads matrix artifacts by `releaseId`, preventing split draft releases from breaking merged `latest.json` and `SHA256SUMS.txt` generation across macOS, Windows, and Linux.

---
## [0.20.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- **Codex now includes a dedicated Wakeup Tasks workspace for OAuth accounts**: the Codex page adds a `Wakeup Tasks` tab where users can create daily/weekly/interval jobs, check Codex CLI availability and install hints, run manual wakeup tests, preview upcoming runs, and review per-account execution history with live progress.

### Changed
- **Codex wakeup execution is now backed by persisted desktop scheduling instead of page-local state only**: task definitions and run history are saved locally, the desktop app starts a background scheduler on launch, manual task runs refresh Codex account data after completion, and Windows wakeup runs launch the Codex CLI without showing a console window.

### Fixed
- **Modal failure feedback is now kept inside the active dialog across account, wakeup, verification, fingerprint, and instance flows**: delete/save/bind errors now keep the modal open, render in a dedicated in-modal error area, auto-scroll to the failing section, and clear stale errors before the next submit or when the modal closes.

---
## [0.19.2] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- **Windows floating-card action buttons no longer get swallowed by window dragging hit-tests**: clicking the floating card's close, pin, and account-navigation controls now consistently triggers the intended action instead of being misclassified as a drag start when the pointer lands on SVG icon nodes.

---
## [0.19.1] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- **Bundled macOS menu-bar builds no longer crash when opening the native Swift tray menu**: native menu provider icons are now bundled into the main app resources and loaded from the packaged app bundle, so clicking the menu-bar entry in the released `.app` no longer triggers a missing-resource assertion in `Bundle.module`.

---
## [0.19.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- **Added a dedicated floating account card window with current/recommended account preview, quick switch, pinning, and instance-bound overlays**: the app can now show a compact floating card on startup or on demand from Settings/Tray, supports per-instance floating cards bound to managed instances, remembers window position, and provides close-confirm guidance plus direct navigation back to the main page.
- **macOS tray interaction now includes a native Swift popover menu for account overviews and switching**: the menu-bar entry now opens a native provider switcher and account card panel backed by synced platform snapshots, with direct actions for switching accounts, opening details, and reopening the main window.

### Changed
- **Provider current-account resolution is now unified around real local bindings and runtime state instead of browser-only guesses**: Cursor, Gemini, Kiro, Windsurf, CodeBuddy, CodeBuddy CN, Qoder, Trae, WorkBuddy, and Zed now resolve their current account through backend store logic, and dashboard/account pages/tray/floating card all reuse the same current-account state instead of diverging through `localStorage`-only fallbacks.
- **Platform account export now follows the accounts currently visible on the page after filtering**: bulk export on provider pages now exports the filtered account list shown in the current view, and when some visible accounts are selected it exports only those visible selections instead of including hidden selections from outside the current filter scope.
- **Current-account refresh now propagates to runtime surfaces immediately after sync or switch**: Antigravity client sync now refreshes the tray after reading local client state, provider stores refresh current-account state after account fetch/switch, and shared account pages no longer hardcode the `Available AI Credits` label outside locale keys.

---
## [0.18.3] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Provider account indexes now auto-repair from local detail files when the index is missing, empty, or corrupted**: Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Gemini, Kiro, Qoder, Trae, Windsurf, CodeBuddy, CodeBuddy CN, WorkBuddy, and Zed now back up the broken index, rescan per-account detail JSON files, rebuild the account list in recency order, and write the recovered index back to disk before the page continues loading.

### Changed
- **Account pages now show unrecoverable local file corruption more directly**: shared provider account pages now reuse the corrupted-file parser so users see the damaged file name instead of only a generic error when automatic repair cannot recover the index.

---
## [0.18.2] - 2026-03-22

### Changed
- **Account groups now follow the real local persistence path instead of browser-only storage**: group definitions are now saved in `~/.antigravity_cockpit/account_groups.json`, legacy `localStorage` data is migrated on first load, and moving accounts between groups updates the persisted group file rather than only changing frontend state.
- **Grouped account management on the account page is now denser and easier to operate**: list and compact views surface group rows inline, selected accounts inside a group can be moved to another group or removed directly from the breadcrumb actions, and the group member picker reuses the same tier/tag filters as the main page.

### Added
- **Account tag editing now supports per-account notes saved with the account record**: the tag modal can edit up to 200 characters of notes alongside tags, and the new notes field is written through the account persistence layer so it stays available across restarts.

---
## [0.18.1] - 2026-03-22

### Changed
- **Zed account presentation is now unified across the account page, dashboard, and tray**: Zed plan labels now strip the `zed_` prefix and display the remaining raw identifier in uppercase, dashboard badges reuse the same visual treatment as the main account page, and `Edit Predictions` summaries keep single-line `used / total` output in compact cards.
- **Zed menu-bar behavior now follows the saved platform layout and desktop-derived status fields consistently**: disabling Zed in the tray layout no longer gets reverted by legacy migration, the side-menu/platform-layout entry is available again, and tray summaries now match the main page by showing `Edit Predictions` plus overdue status instead of stale token-spend rows.

---
## [0.18.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Zed account management is now supported end-to-end with official native-app OAuth, JSON import, local current-session import, and real credential apply-back into the official client**: added a dedicated Zed account page, local account storage/indexing, current-session runtime controls, and account apply/restart behavior aligned with the official desktop credential slot.
- **Zed is now integrated into dashboard summaries, global account transfer bundles, and platform settings**: dashboard cards, transfer export/import, launch-path configuration, auto-refresh cadence, and quota-alert settings now include Zed.

### Changed
- **Zed quota display now follows the desktop client's actual account API instead of browser billing pages**: the page now focuses on `Edit Predictions` and overdue-invoice status from `/client/users/me`, supports importing the currently signed-in local account, and logs the raw refresh payload for diagnostics.
- **Zed platform presentation has been tightened for the current rollout**: the app now uses the official Zed application icon, the add-account modal is aligned with the shared `OAuth / Token / Import` structure, and the side-menu entry is hidden while menu maintenance remains paused.

---
## [0.17.8] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- **Codex API Key accounts now write the official `openai_base_url` key into `~/.codex/config.toml` when a custom base URL is configured**: account switching and local injection no longer persist the incorrect `base_url` key, so Codex can read the configured upstream API endpoint correctly.

---
## [0.17.7] - 2026-03-21

### Changed
- **Windsurf usage summaries in both dashboard and tray now stay aligned with the official quota vs. credits billing model**: quota-billed accounts now show daily quota usage, weekly quota usage, and extra usage balance, while credits-billed accounts keep the credits-left breakdown without being misclassified by enum-style billing strategy values.
- **Dashboard account cards now render platform-specific quota structures more faithfully across multiple providers**: Kiro, Gemini, CodeBuddy, CodeBuddy CN, Qoder, Trae, and WorkBuddy cards now show the correct remaining/used summaries, reset or expiry timing, and related status details through the shared account presentation layer.

---
## [0.17.6] - 2026-03-20

### Changed
- **Windsurf usage-mode detection now follows the official billing-strategy enums end-to-end**: the account page now normalizes raw `BILLING_STRATEGY_*` values before deciding between quota and credits, preventing official quota accounts from being misclassified when Windsurf stores enum-style strategy strings.
- **Windsurf quota panels now keep the official three-field summary visible**: quota-billed accounts now always render daily quota usage, weekly quota usage, and extra usage balance, defaulting the extra-balance row to `$0.00` when the local snapshot does not include an upstream balance value.

---
## [0.17.5] - 2026-03-20

### Changed
- **Windsurf account usage now follows the official billing mode presentation**: quota-billed accounts now show daily/weekly quota usage, reset times, and extra usage balance, while credits-billed accounts show combined credits left with prompt/add-on breakdown.
- **Manual help entry is now unified across dashboard and overview headers**: dashboard and platform overview headers now reuse one shared help icon button with consistent sizing, hover feedback, and navigation behavior.

---
## [0.17.4] - 2026-03-20

### Changed
- **Account plan filtering now supports multi-select across major account pages**: Accounts, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, GitHub Copilot, Kiro, Qoder, Trae, Windsurf, CodeBuddy, CodeBuddy CN, and WorkBuddy pages now allow selecting multiple plan/status types in one pass.
- **Plan filter interaction is now unified through a shared dropdown component**: introduced reusable multi-select filter UI with selected-count indicator, one-click clear, and consistent filtering behavior across provider pages.

---
## [0.17.3] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **Desktop now includes a built-in live log viewer for runtime diagnostics**: added a floating log entry button in the main window, with latest-log tail view, auto refresh, line-limit control, clear/copy content, copy log path, and one-click open log directory.
- **Backend log commands now support latest-file snapshot and bounded tail reads**: added latest `app.log*` discovery, tail line clamping, and cross-platform log-directory open commands for frontend diagnostics.

### Changed
- **CodeBuddy and WorkBuddy usage-state rendering is now unified with explicit abnormal details**: account cards/tables now show a normalized abnormal state with a detail modal and masked account context, and CodeBuddy/WorkBuddy instance quota previews now use shared dosage-notify renderers for consistent output.

---
## [0.17.2] - 2026-03-20

### Changed
- **Windows Codex launch now aligns to the Microsoft Store system registration entry by default**: startup now prefers Store AppUserModelId (`shell:AppsFolder`) instead of directly executing `WindowsApps/.../Codex.exe`, with exe-path fallback only when Store entry launch is unavailable.
- **Windows Codex launch precheck now validates Store installation availability first**: launch-path readiness now succeeds on detected Store registration entry and only falls back to executable-path validation when needed.

### Added
- **Windows Codex launch logs now explicitly expose startup strategy selection**: launch logs now print whether `system-store-entry` or `exe-path` was used, including matched app id/path and resolved pid for troubleshooting.

---
## [0.17.1] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **Network settings now support a managed global proxy for launched platform processes**: added `global_proxy_enabled`/`global_proxy_url`/`global_proxy_no_proxy`, with env injection into Cockpit-launched platform apps and instance start flows across macOS/Linux/Windows.
- **GitHub Copilot switching now supports OpenCode sync controls and launch toggle**: added quick-settings/general-config options to control GitHub Copilot app auto-launch, OpenCode auth overwrite, and OpenCode restart after switch.

### Changed
- **OpenCode restart toggles now follow auth-overwrite dependency in both Settings and Quick Settings**: when auth overwrite is turned off, related restart toggles are now automatically turned off for both Codex and GitHub Copilot switch flows.

---
## [0.17.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Codex account switching now supports an optional OpenClaw login-overwrite toggle**: Settings and Quick Settings now expose `openclaw_auth_overwrite_on_switch`; when disabled, only Codex is switched and OpenClaw keeps its current login state.

### Changed
- **Codex-to-OpenClaw credential sync now writes and verifies `openai-codex:default` end-to-end**: switch flow now updates OpenClaw `auth-profiles.json`, cleans stale `openai-codex:*` profiles, syncs candidate paths, and validates account/email/expiry consistency with Codex credentials.
- **macOS Codex switching now updates keychain `Codex Auth` alongside `auth.json`**: keeps external-cli/OpenClaw credential reads aligned with the active Codex account.
- **OpenClaw post-sync runtime refresh now retries reload/restart for faster effect**: after sync it attempts `secrets reload` and `gateway restart`, then performs one retry and logs actionable diagnostics if consistency checks still fail.

---
## [0.16.3] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Kiro Enterprise/IdC local-import accounts now support AWS IAM Identity Center OIDC refresh path**: the refresh flow now prefers OIDC token refresh with local IdC context and falls back to Kiro `refreshToken` endpoint for compatibility.

### Changed
- **Kiro plan/tier badge text now follows raw subscription values first**: account and instance views now prioritize `plan_name`/`plan_tier`/usage raw labels to stay aligned with official client naming.
- **Kiro import parser now keeps Enterprise refresh context fields**: JSON import now carries `authMethod`, `login_option`, `startUrl`, `client_secret`, and related IdC fields for post-import refresh continuity.
- **Kiro flow-notice localization now reflects actual Enterprise refresh network scope across all supported languages**: wording now explicitly covers AWS OIDC calls and required OIDC auth fields.

---
## [0.16.2] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Codex API Key accounts now support custom Base URL end-to-end with local persistence**: API Key add/import/switch flows now read and write `base_url` (including `config.toml`) and keep account metadata synced with local auth files.
- **Codex API Key accounts now support in-place credential editing**: account cards/tables add an edit action for API Key + Base URL, and backend updates account id/index, current-account mapping, and instance bindings in one operation.

### Changed
- **Codex quota-error cards/tables now provide direct OAuth reauthorize action for token-invalid scenarios**: `401`/`token_invalidated`-like errors can jump back into OAuth authorization from the quota error area.

### Fixed
- **Local-import account lists now refresh more reliably across pages**: shared provider, Codex, Qoder, and generic accounts pages add a short delayed refetch after import to avoid transient index-write lag.
- **Trae refresh diagnostics are now richer for non-JSON upstream responses**: parse errors now include HTTP status, key response headers, and a safe body preview to speed up troubleshooting.

---
## [0.16.1] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **Codex now supports API Key account onboarding and import paths end-to-end**: added dedicated API Key add flow, `auth_mode=apikey` persistence in `~/.codex/auth.json`, and JSON/local import compatibility for API Key records.

### Changed
- **Codex account cards/tables now adapt to API Key account behavior**: API Key accounts support inline rename, show masked key metadata, hide unsupported quota-refresh actions, and provide a direct link to OpenAI Usage.
- **Codex backend refresh/injection paths now skip OAuth-only operations for API Key accounts**: profile/quota refresh and refresh-all scheduling bypass API Key accounts while keeping account switching and auth-file write behavior aligned with local storage rules.
- **Codex instance account picker now uses the same presentation display name logic as the account list**: renamed API Key accounts are shown consistently in instance selection.

---
## [0.16.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **Cross-platform account transfer center in Settings**: Added one-click export/import for all platforms with a unified JSON bundle schema, platform-level import progress, and modal/file workflows.
- **Platform grouping and quick-switch UX across core surfaces**: Added editable platform groups (name, icon, default child, child-level metadata), group switcher in headers, grouped cards on dashboard, and grouped entry rendering in side navigation and layout modal.
- **Custom group icon library with local persistence**: Added icon upload, reuse, and cleanup for group/child icons in platform layout configuration.

### Changed
- **Tray layout model now supports ordered entries plus platform groups**: tray persistence now stores `orderedEntryIds` + `platformGroups`, and tray menu rendering now understands grouped entries while keeping manual ordering and visibility controls.
- **macOS app launch flow now aligns around LaunchServices `open -n -a` with PID probing for isolated instances**: Antigravity/Codex/VS Code/CodeBuddy/CodeBuddy CN/WorkBuddy plus Qoder/Trae/Cursor/Kiro/Windsurf start paths now use consistent launch semantics and post-launch PID matching for target profiles.
- **Account refresh reliability improved with delayed retry across providers**: Antigravity quota refresh and multiple provider token/profile/quota refresh paths now perform one delayed retry with unified logs before surfacing failure.
- **Codex OAuth add-account flow now supports in-place token-exchange retry**: OAuth error state now exposes a retry action for token exchange without restarting the full authorization flow.
- **Settings, dashboard, and navigation visuals were updated for grouped-platform operations**: added new layout/modal/switcher/transfer styles and supporting locale keys across all supported languages.

---
## [0.15.1] - 2026-03-16

### Changed
- **Codex auto-switch and quota alerts now support independent `primary_window`/`secondary_window` thresholds end-to-end**: backend config normalization, candidate selection, cooldown keys, and post-refresh checks now evaluate dual thresholds and can switch accounts before alerting when a better candidate exists.
- **Codex Quick Settings now expose dual-window controls for auto-switch and quota alerts**: added dedicated percentage inputs for `primary_window` and `secondary_window`, plus combined OR-condition hints and modal threshold display.
- **Codex quota refresh scheduling now includes a 60-second current-account refresh when auto-switch or quota alerts are enabled**: improves trigger timeliness without changing existing full-refresh interval behavior.
- **Default-instance launches triggered by switching now pass saved extra args for Antigravity and Codex**: switch flows and the default Codex instance start path now reuse configured `extra_args` instead of dropping them.
- **Codex refresh flows now always update current-account state after refresh**: manual and batch refresh paths now hydrate both account list and current account for consistent UI state.
- **Windows main window default width increased to 1250**: provides more horizontal space for account and quick-settings content.

---
## [0.15.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **WorkBuddy platform full integration with account sync and instance management**: Added WorkBuddy backend/frontend modules, OAuth/Token/JSON/local import flows, account switching via local credential injection, dashboard/settings/quick-settings/tray integration, and bidirectional account sync with CodeBuddy CN.
- **Token-protected HTTP usage report service with optional HTML rendering**: Added configurable `/report` endpoint (`report_enabled` + port + token) that aggregates multi-platform quota summaries and supports raw Markdown/YAML output plus `render=true` HTML view for browser inspection.

### Changed
- **CodeBuddy, CodeBuddy CN, and WorkBuddy runtime flows are now structurally aligned**: Moved cross-platform sync/injection paths into WorkBuddy domain modules, unified command registration, and reduced duplicated maintenance paths.
- **Account injection/startup reliability and operator guidance are improved**: CodeBuddy/CodeBuddy CN/WorkBuddy instance injection now includes post-write verification and clearer “sign in manually first” guidance for keychain/state-db failure cases.
- **Rendered report readability and staleness metadata are enhanced**: Report pages now group rows more clearly, show human-readable local timestamps, and expose delayed-refresh/stale-data notes directly in report metadata.

### Contributors
- `PR #213` by `@lihongjing-2023`: WorkBuddy platform integration and account sync.
- `PR #212` by `@lovitus`: tokenized web report service and rendered report improvements.

---
## [0.14.5] - 2026-03-15

### Changed
- **Startup work after upgrade is now lighter and more staggered**: boot now renders immediately with built-in `en`/`zh-CN` resources instead of blocking first paint on async language loading, auto-refresh timer setup is deferred, dashboard platform prefetch is batched, and frontend vendor/update chunks are split more aggressively to reduce first-launch stalls after larger upgrades.

### Fixed
- **Codex account refresh now recovers from backend-invalidated auth tokens**: quota refresh and account-profile checks now detect `401 token_invalidated`, force one refresh-token exchange, persist the rotated tokens, and retry the official ChatGPT usage/account-check endpoints instead of surfacing a false “sign in again” failure while the same account can still be used in the official client.
- **Codex default instance launch on macOS no longer reuses another running isolated instance**: when a non-default Codex instance is already open, starting the default instance now forces a fresh LaunchServices app instance so the default profile opens instead of just focusing the existing isolated window.

---
## [0.14.4] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- **Cursor account list now self-heals from local account files when index is missing or corrupted**: listing now recovers accounts from `cursor_accounts/*.json`, rewrites `cursor_accounts.json`, and keeps accounts/tags visible instead of showing an empty list when only the index file is damaged.
- **Cursor account list now uses the same index lock as write operations**: `list_accounts` is serialized with import/delete/update paths to reduce race windows during concurrent index access.

---
## [0.14.3] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- **OAuth add-account dialogs now reliably re-open for repeated sign-ins across platforms**: after OAuth success, Codex and shared provider OAuth flows now clear pending-session/UI residue (auth URL, timeout/polling/manual-callback state) immediately and on modal close/tab change, preventing subsequent logins from stalling after `OAuth start`.

---
## [0.14.2] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- **GitHub Copilot switching now falls back to VS Code Insiders local storage automatically**: when the standard VS Code `Code` user-data path is missing, default-instance and token-injection flows now probe `Code - Insiders` for `state.vscdb`, Windows `Local State`, and VS Code safe-storage credentials, restoring switching for Insiders-only installs.

---
## [0.14.1] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **CodeBuddy/CodeBuddy CN resource-package quota is now shown directly in app**: account cards and tables now render per-package quota amount, progress, and refresh/expiry time (including extra credits) without requiring web-only viewing.
- **CodeBuddy CN Token import now hydrates quota metadata immediately**: Token import now pulls dosage/payment/user-resource payloads and persists them into quota and usage fields during account creation.

### Changed
- **Quota refresh now uses IDE access tokens instead of Cookie binding**: backend refresh now calls `/v2/billing/meter/get-user-resource` with Bearer token and identity headers, and writes refresh errors into account state for UI visibility.
- **Legacy manual quota-binding flow is removed across backend and frontend**: removed cURL replay binding, binding-clear commands, and related service/type paths for both CodeBuddy and CodeBuddy CN.
- **Localization copy is aligned with the new quota model across all locales**: removed obsolete Cookie-binding flow text, updated network-scope wording to resource-package quota refresh, and added package-title keys for base/activity packages in all supported languages.
- **HTTP decoding compatibility for quota APIs is expanded**: `reqwest` now enables `brotli`/`deflate`/`zstd` features to handle compressed billing responses more reliably.

### Fixed
- **Quota summary and recommendation no longer depend on legacy binding state**: resource summary no longer returns `null` when `quota_binding` is absent, preventing fallback-only recommendation behavior after token refresh.

---
## [0.14.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **CodeBuddy CN platform full integration**: Added CodeBuddy CN models, commands, modules, OAuth flow, account pages, services, stores, icons, navigation, dashboard/tray wiring, and multi-instance management support.
- **CodeBuddy CN account lifecycle support**: Added browser-based OAuth login, Token/JSON import, local client import, account switching with local credential injection, tag management, and account export.
- **Manual OAuth callback URL input**: OAuth flows that rely on a local callback port now support manual callback URL input when automatic callback capture is unavailable, improving authorization success in restricted network environments.

### Changed
- **CodeBuddy/CodeBuddy CN quota display simplified**: Quota information is now viewed on the web page; removed complex in-app quota query form for a cleaner account page experience.
- **Shared runtime surfaces now cover eleven platforms**: Dashboard, tray, settings, quick settings, auto-refresh scheduling, quota-alert preferences, navigation, and README/docs now include CodeBuddy CN consistently.

### Fixed
- **Qoder import now refreshes account list**: JSON and Token import on Qoder platform now correctly refresh account data after successful import, fixing display issues where imported accounts were not shown immediately.
- **Local import now refreshes tray summaries across multiple platforms**: Antigravity, Codex, Cursor, Kiro, Windsurf, Trae, and Qoder now update the tray menu immediately after successful local import, preventing shared-runtime summaries from staying stale after import.

---
## [0.13.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Qoder platform full integration across backend and frontend**: Added Qoder models, commands, modules, official CLI device-login flow, local/JSON import, account pages, services, stores, icons, navigation, dashboard/tray wiring, and raw-plan/quota presentation.
- **Qoder account switching and multi-instance management**: Added Qoder credential injection, default-instance binding, isolated multi-instance profiles, start/stop/open-window/close-all controls, and launch-path detection for macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- **Trae platform full integration across backend and frontend**: Added Trae models, commands, modules, OAuth flow, local/JSON import, account pages, services, stores, icons, navigation, dashboard/tray wiring, and plan/usage presentation.
- **Trae account switching and multi-instance management**: Added Trae local auth write-back using the client's actual on-disk rules, default-instance binding, isolated multi-instance profiles, start/stop/open-window/close-all controls, and launch-path detection for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

### Changed
- **Shared runtime surfaces now cover ten platforms**: Dashboard, tray, settings, quick settings, auto-refresh scheduling, quota-alert preferences, navigation, and README/docs now include Qoder and Trae consistently.
- **Settings now expose Qoder/Trae path and quota controls**: General settings now cover Qoder/Trae auto-refresh, launch paths, and quota alerts in one place.
- **Gemini platform wording is now aligned as Gemini Cli**: Shared navigation, settings, and account-management labels now consistently use `Gemini Cli`.

### Fixed
- **Pending OAuth sessions are now cancelled when dialogs or pages close**: Provider OAuth flows now cancel in-flight authorization sessions on modal close, tab switch, or page unload to avoid stale pending sessions.
- **Windows updater now keeps installer type consistent to avoid duplicate desktop shortcuts**: Windows update checks now pass an explicit updater target based on the current bundle type (`windows-*-nsis` / `windows-*-msi`), and merged `latest.json` now points the `windows-x86_64` fallback to NSIS to prevent installer-type drift from recreating desktop shortcuts during update.

---
## [0.12.3] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **macOS permission prompts no longer attribute to Cockpit Tools**: All IDE launches (Codex, VS Code, CodeBuddy) on macOS now use `open -a` via LaunchServices instead of direct binary execution, so macOS TCC permission dialogs (e.g. Downloads folder access) correctly attribute to the launched IDE rather than Cockpit Tools. Multi-instance PID tracking is preserved through post-launch process polling.

---
## [0.12.2] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Linux package installs now support managed in-app updates**: Added `.deb`/`.rpm` runtime detection, signed package download, progress reporting, and privileged install flow so Linux package-manager installs can complete updates directly in Cockpit.
- **Antigravity accounts now support local account groups**: Added local folder-style account groups on the Antigravity accounts page, including create/rename/delete, batch add/remove, grouped browsing, and per-group quota refresh.

### Changed
- **Windsurf plan presentation now recognizes more official tiers**: Windsurf account cards, badges, and filters now resolve Trial, Teams, Teams Ultimate, and Pro Ultimate labels from remote plan data and teams-tier metadata.
- **Linux updater behavior now matches package-managed installs**: Background silent download is skipped for managed `.deb`/`.rpm` installs, and the sidebar/update dialog now shows authorization and installation progress states during one-click update.
- **Quota alert native notifications now follow the selected UI language**: Backend notification text now resolves from locale keys and covers Codex, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Kiro, Cursor, Gemini, and CodeBuddy consistently.

### Fixed
- **Wakeup task creation/test now checks runtime readiness first**: Opening “new task” and “test task” now stops early and reuses the existing runtime-path guidance when the wakeup runtime is not configured.
- **Settings and recovery dialogs now surface action failures inline**: Quick Settings path/config errors, file-corruption “open folder” failures, and global modal action failures are now shown in the UI instead of only logging to console.
- **macOS quota alerts no longer keep a click-wait notification loop alive**: Native quota notifications now use fire-and-forget delivery to avoid unnecessary background energy usage after notification delivery.

---
## [0.12.1] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **Codex account profile hydration from official account-check endpoint**: Added a `refresh_codex_account_profile` backend/frontend flow to fetch and persist `account_name` and `account_structure`.
- **Automatic profile hydration for team-like Codex accounts**: Added store-level background hydration for accounts missing structure/name metadata, with in-flight de-duplication and a 5-minute retry interval.

### Changed
- **Codex account cards and tables now display account context**: account rows now show “Personal account” or hydrated team/workspace names based on structure, plan type, and workspace metadata.
- **Codex instance quota preview now follows Code Review visibility preference**: when Code Review quota is hidden in preferences, instance-page badges, search text, and quota preview now hide it consistently.

---
## [0.12.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **CodeBuddy platform full integration across backend and frontend**: Added CodeBuddy models, commands, modules, OAuth flow, account pages, services, stores, icons, navigation, dashboard wiring, and shared platform metadata.
- **CodeBuddy account lifecycle support**: Added browser-based OAuth login, Token/JSON import, quota query and binding, cycle/resource/extra-credit presentation, tag editing, bulk actions, account export, and local credential injection for account switching.
- **CodeBuddy multi-instance management**: Added CodeBuddy instance store and commands with isolated user-data directories, account binding, instance create/update/delete, start/stop, open-window, and close-all controls.
- **CodeBuddy quota binding supports full cURL replay**: Added a full `Copy as cURL (bash)` workflow for `get-user-resource`, replaying the original request (method/headers/body) to improve binding accuracy and persist normalized quota binding parameters.

### Changed
- **CodeBuddy is now integrated into shared runtime surfaces**: Added CodeBuddy app-path detection, auto-refresh interval, quota-alert settings, Quick Settings, tray summaries, and global refresh scheduling.
- **Cursor switch now attempts to launch the default instance after injection**: switching a Cursor account now updates the default-instance binding and tries to start Cursor immediately, while still emitting unified path-missing guidance when the app path is unavailable.
- **Codex quota presentation is now consolidated into one flexible column**: the Accounts table now renders all quota windows in a single area, and Code Review quota visibility can be toggled from preferences.

### Fixed
- **Codex account switching now respects `CODEX_HOME`**: Codex auth file read/write now honors custom `CODEX_HOME` (including quoted env values), and auth write errors now include explicit target paths for troubleshooting.
- **Secondary windows no longer inherit main-window close interception**: non-main windows now close directly instead of being incorrectly blocked by the tray/minimize confirmation flow.
- **Windsurf safe-storage key lookup is now provider-specific**: macOS and Linux credential handling no longer falls back to generic VS Code safe-storage entries, reducing wrong-key reads during injection.

---
## [0.11.3] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed
- **Gemini OAuth app identity now matches official Gemini CLI**: Gemini authorization now uses the official Gemini CLI OAuth client credentials, so the consent page aligns with `Gemini Code Assist and Gemini CLI` instead of legacy app identity.
- **Gemini web OAuth callback flow now aligns with official behavior**: the browser auth URL uses the official parameter set (without extra `prompt=consent`), and callback handling now redirects to the official Gemini success/failure pages.

---
## [0.11.2] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- **Antigravity default-instance custom launch args now take effect**: launching the default Antigravity instance now parses and passes saved `extra_args` to the actual process start command.
- **Remote debugging launch flags can now be applied from Cockpit settings**: flags such as `--remote-debugging-port=9333` are no longer silently dropped in the default-instance start path.

---
## [0.11.1] - 2026-03-08

### Changed
- **Gemini import now validates token state immediately**: JSON import and local `~/.gemini` import now trigger a post-import token refresh, so account metadata is synchronized right after import.
- **Gemini refresh state is now persisted on every outcome**: refresh failures now write `status=error` plus `status_reason` to the account record, and successful refreshes clear the error status.

### Fixed
- **Gemini refresh failures no longer stay as log-only signals**: failed manual or batch refresh attempts are now persisted to account status fields for consistent UI visibility.

---
## [0.11.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- **Gemini platform full integration across backend and frontend**: Added Gemini models/commands/modules/OAuth on Tauri side, plus account pages, services, stores, icons, navigation, and platform metadata wiring on frontend.
- **Gemini account lifecycle support**: Added OAuth login, Access Token/JSON import, local `~/.gemini` import, quota refresh, tag management, account export, and local credential injection for account switching.
- **Gemini multi-instance management**: Added Gemini instance store/commands with default and custom profile directories, account binding/injection, launch command generation, and one-click terminal execution.
- **Gemini settings and runtime integration**: Added `gemini_auto_refresh_minutes`, Gemini quota-alert enable/threshold config, and integrated Gemini into Settings, Quick Settings, auto-refresh scheduler, dashboard, and tray/runtime surfaces.
- **Gemini docs and i18n coverage**: Updated README (EN/ZH) and locale keys for Gemini overview, instance workflows, switching, importing, and flow notices.

### Changed
- **Post-switch UX now supports provider-specific success actions**: `useProviderAccountsPage` now exposes an inject-success callback; Gemini overview uses it to open a launch-command modal immediately after switching.
- **Gemini launch semantics aligned with default-instance behavior**: Default-instance launch command now uses plain `gemini`; custom instances keep `GEMINI_CLI_HOME=... gemini`.
- **Gemini launch modal wording updated for generic use**: Launch dialog title now uses “Launch Instance” instead of a multi-instance-specific label.
- **Gemini instance UI simplified to match actual CLI behavior**: Removed runtime-state/PID/stop expectations in Gemini instance list and aligned default-instance edit behavior with real launch semantics.
- **Shared platform/presentation pipeline expanded for Gemini**: Added Gemini to shared platform typing/navigation/meta and unified Gemini account plan/quota presentation in reusable account view helpers.

---
## [0.10.1] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- **Cursor platform end-to-end integration**: Added full Cursor account and multi-instance support across backend commands/modules, frontend pages/stores/services, side navigation, tabs, dashboard cards, and tray integration.
- **Cursor account management capability set**: Added OAuth (PKCE), Token/JSON import, local `state.vscdb` import, account export, and account injection back to Cursor profile data for switching.
- **Cursor quota and subscription pipeline**: Added official refresh chain (`usage-summary`, `GetUserMeta`, Stripe profile endpoints), including Total/Auto/API/On-Demand metrics and team-limit parsing.
- **Cursor settings and automation wiring**: Added Cursor app path, auto-refresh interval, and quota-alert enable/threshold in both Settings and Quick Settings, and integrated Cursor into global auto-refresh.
- **Cross-platform existing-directory instance mode**: Added `existingDir` initialization mode for Antigravity/Codex/GitHub Copilot/Windsurf/Kiro/Cursor to register existing local directories as instances.
- **Fingerprint preview autofill support**: Added preview-current-profile autofill/writeback for missing fields and frontend field-level auto-generated indicators.

### Changed
- **App framework now includes Cursor globally**: added Cursor routing/page mounting, dashboard current/recommended account card actions, platform typing/navigation expansion, and platform metadata wiring.
- **System tray startup and rendering path was upgraded**: tray now boots with a lightweight skeleton menu first and asynchronously loads full account-driven menus; Cursor tray summaries and platform ordering are included.
- **Startup blocking work was reduced**: settings merge and log cleanup were moved to background threads; i18n startup preloads `en` resources and uses an explicit loading shell before app mount.
- **Settings/Quick Settings/config schema expanded**: added `cursor_auto_refresh_minutes`, `cursor_app_path`, `cursor_quota_alert_enabled`, and `cursor_quota_alert_threshold`, with backward-compatible config normalization.
- **Instance workflow enhancements across providers**: Antigravity/Codex/GitHub Copilot/Windsurf/Kiro/Cursor now validate and support `existingDir` creation mode in backend and frontend forms.
- **Codex account presentation expanded**: added auth metadata parsing (`Signed in with <provider>`, ID details) and a dedicated Code Review quota metric in cards/tables.
- **Plan/tier badge styling unified**: introduced shared `--plan-*` design tokens and switched account/instance pages to common badge color mapping.
- **Localization coverage was expanded for new Cursor flows**: updated locale keys across supported language packs for Cursor pages, OAuth/import flow, `existingDir` instance mode, quick settings, and quota display copy.

### Fixed
- **Provider account dedup correctness improved**: GitHub Copilot and Windsurf now deduplicate by `github_id`; Kiro avoids email-only merges when `user_id` presence conflicts.
- **Kiro account deduplication issue fixed**: Fixed the Kiro account merge path (`b045e1e2`) where different user identities could be incorrectly merged under the same email and cause account overwrite.
- **Fingerprint preview data consistency improved**: reading current profile now autofills missing fingerprint fields, returns generated-field markers, and attempts writeback to storage.
- **Path-missing guidance chain now covers Cursor fully**: `APP_PATH_NOT_FOUND:cursor` is handled by unified set/reset/detect/retry flow.

---
## [0.10.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- **Cursor platform end-to-end integration**: Added full Cursor account and multi-instance support across backend commands/modules, frontend pages/stores/services, side navigation, tabs, dashboard cards, and tray integration.
- **Cursor account management capability set**: Added OAuth (PKCE), Token/JSON import, local `state.vscdb` import, account export, and account injection back to Cursor profile data for switching.
- **Cursor quota and subscription pipeline**: Added official refresh chain (`usage-summary`, `GetUserMeta`, Stripe profile endpoints), including Total/Auto/API/On-Demand metrics and team-limit parsing.
- **Cursor settings and automation wiring**: Added Cursor app path, auto-refresh interval, and quota-alert enable/threshold in both Settings and Quick Settings, and integrated Cursor into global auto-refresh.
- **Cross-platform existing-directory instance mode**: Added `existingDir` initialization mode for Antigravity/Codex/GitHub Copilot/Windsurf/Kiro/Cursor to register existing local directories as instances.

### Changed
- **App framework now includes Cursor globally**: added Cursor routing/page mounting, dashboard current/recommended account card actions, platform typing/navigation expansion, and platform metadata wiring.
- **System tray startup and rendering path was upgraded**: tray now boots with a lightweight skeleton menu first and asynchronously loads full account-driven menus; Cursor tray summaries and platform ordering are included.
- **Startup blocking work was reduced**: settings merge and log cleanup were moved to background threads; i18n startup preloads `en` resources and uses an explicit loading shell before app mount.
- **Settings/Quick Settings/config schema expanded**: added `cursor_auto_refresh_minutes`, `cursor_app_path`, `cursor_quota_alert_enabled`, and `cursor_quota_alert_threshold`, with backward-compatible config normalization.
- **Instance workflow enhancements across providers**: Antigravity/Codex/GitHub Copilot/Windsurf/Kiro/Cursor now validate and support `existingDir` creation mode in backend and frontend forms.
- **Codex account presentation expanded**: added auth metadata parsing (`Signed in with <provider>`, ID details) and a dedicated Code Review quota metric in cards/tables.
- **Plan/tier badge styling unified**: introduced shared `--plan-*` design tokens and switched account/instance pages to common badge color mapping.
- **Localization coverage was expanded for new Cursor flows**: updated locale keys across supported language packs for Cursor pages, OAuth/import flow, `existingDir` instance mode, quick settings, and quota display copy.

### Fixed

- **Fingerprint preview data consistency improved**: reading current profile now autofills missing fingerprint fields, returns generated-field markers, and attempts writeback to storage.
- **Path-missing guidance chain now covers Cursor fully**: `APP_PATH_NOT_FOUND:cursor` is handled by unified set/reset/detect/retry flow.

---
## [0.9.17] - 2026-03-06

### Changed
- **Windows Codex path reset detection is now Store-first and drive-aware**: Path reset now scans `C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\OpenAI.Codex_*\app\Codex.exe` and `<Drive>:\WindowsApps\OpenAI.Codex_*\app\Codex.exe` across drives, selects the highest package version, and falls back to Appx `InstallLocation\app\Codex.exe` when direct scan misses.
- **Startup auto app-path probing was removed**: The app no longer runs automatic app-path detection during startup; path detection now runs on explicit reset or launch-missing-path flows.
- **Announcement delivery remains non-intrusive**: New announcements continue to use unread badge indication and no longer force-open the detail modal.

### Fixed
- **Windows Codex default launch now works with configured path**: Added Windows default-instance launch flow for Codex so launch/switch-triggered start can execute when `codex_app_path` is configured.
- **Instance actions no longer stay disabled after stop**: After stopping an instance, row actions are re-enabled in-place without requiring page navigation refresh.
- **Restored macOS Codex multi-instance behavior after 0.9.16 regression**: Reverted the 0.9.16 Codex single-instance restriction impact on macOS, restoring multi-instance launch/control flow to the v0.9.15 behavior baseline.
- **Restored Codex PID recognition on macOS instance rows**: Brought back instance-home-based process matching so running Codex instances can be identified and displayed with PID correctly.

---
## [0.9.16] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- **Windows Codex desktop control management**: Added first-class Windows support for Codex desktop process control, including launch, stop, focus, and restart flow (close first, then reopen).
- **Windows Codex auto path detection for Store installs**: Added Appx-based path detection via `OpenAI.Codex` `InstallLocation\\app\\Codex.exe`, so Cockpit can resolve Codex executable path in Microsoft Store installation scenarios.

### Changed
- **Announcement delivery is now non-intrusive by default**: New announcements no longer force-open the detail modal; unread items are indicated by the red badge only and are opened manually from Announcement Center.
- **Codex account identity display is now compact and single-line**: Codex account cards/tables now show `Signed in with <provider> | Account ID: <id>` in one line, and workspace name is removed from default account identity display to reduce UI noise.
- **Codex code review quota label is fixed to English**: The code review quota metric now always uses `Code Review` as the display label.
- **Windows Codex control model aligned to official single-instance lock**: Codex multi-instance is now explicitly marked unsupported on Windows/macOS in Codex instance management, with clear UI/backend reason text, and operations are constrained to single-instance control semantics.

---
## [0.9.15] - 2026-03-04

### Changed
- **Release publication now waits for full pipeline completion**: The release workflow now creates draft releases first and only marks them as `latest` after matrix builds, merged updater `latest.json`, checksum upload, and Homebrew cask update all succeed. This prevents in-app update prompts from appearing before release artifacts are fully ready.

---
## [0.9.14] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- **Floating sidebar quick-update action**: Added a compact action above the sidebar that follows updater lifecycle states (`Update` / `Downloading %` / `Restart`), so users can continue update flow without reopening settings pages.

### Changed
- **Updater retry and failure handling hardened**: Added retry-with-backoff plus retryable/non-retryable error classification for update check/download, with retry status feedback and sanitized error details in UI/logs.
- **Update check baseline interval changed to 1 hour**: Default update-check interval is now 1 hour, and legacy 6h/24h interval values are migrated to 1 hour automatically when settings are loaded.
- **macOS process probe path for desktop clients was switched to `ps`-first matching**: Antigravity/VS Code/Codex/Kiro/Windsurf process discovery now prioritizes command-line probing and keeps app-root path comparison, reducing protected-directory touches while improving process match stability for instance operations.
- **Antigravity macOS multi-instance startup behavior was tightened**: Non-default instances now launch via `open -n` without `--reuse-window`, and startup includes a short PID resolve polling window (up to 6s) for the target `user-data-dir`.
- **Codex quota refresh now synchronizes plan metadata back to account index**: `plan_type` is now synced from refreshed `id_token` and quota usage response into account summary index, so subscription badges can update without re-import.

### Fixed
- **Reopened update dialog now preserves prepared-update restart state**: If the same version is already downloaded, reopening the update dialog now stays in `Ready to restart` state instead of falling back to `Update now`.
- **Manual dialog restart now reuses unified apply-update pipeline**: `Restart now` in the update dialog now follows the same install/relaunch path as silent updates, preventing state divergence between update entry points.
- **GitHub Copilot instance injection no longer fails on macOS due to wrong Safe Storage key priority**: VS Code/Copilot injection now prefers Code-family Keychain entries before Antigravity entries, preventing `AES-CBC decryption failed: Unpad Error` when decrypting existing `github.auth`.

---
## [0.9.13] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- **Pending update notes local cache for post-restart changelog**: Added persisted `pending_update_notes.json` storage so downloaded update notes can be shown after restart without requiring online changelog fetch.

### Changed
- **Update check source is now fully unified to Tauri Updater metadata**: Removed backend GitHub Releases API polling for version detection; update availability now comes from updater endpoint metadata (`latest.json`) only.
- **Manual/silent update note rendering now reads updater release body**: Update dialog and silent-update pre-cache now parse bilingual sections directly from updater `notes`, while keeping browser-download fallback only for updater failures.

---
## [0.9.12] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- **Background auto update mode (zero-intervention)**: Added a `Settings > General > Background Auto Update` option. When enabled, the app checks updates normally, downloads new packages silently in the background, and prompts restart when the update is ready.
- **Post-update changelog popup on version jump**: Added startup version-jump detection based on locally recorded `last_run_version`. After an upgrade, the app now shows a “What’s New” dialog for the current version.
- **Silent update ready toast with restart action**: Added a bottom-right update toast after background download, with `Later` and `Restart` actions.

### Changed
- **Desktop updater pipeline migrated to Tauri Updater**: Integrated updater/process plugins and enabled updater artifacts + release endpoint config, so in-app update flow uses signed updater metadata.
- **Manual update dialog now supports in-app download/install progress**: The update modal now performs in-app update with progress/status/error display and falls back to opening the GitHub release page when updater flow fails.
- **Update settings persistence behavior was hardened**: Auto-update preference loading/saving now avoids first-render overwrite and only writes when user change or explicit state change is confirmed.
- **Update-related i18n coverage expanded across locale packs**: Added update toggle/progress/restart/version-jump translation keys in all supported locales.

---
## [0.9.11] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed
- **Fixed Windows switch/start crashes on non-ASCII install paths**: Windows extended-path normalization now uses Unicode-safe prefix handling, preventing `byte index is not a char boundary` panics on non-ASCII paths.

### Changed
- **Verification default model selection now prioritizes Flash**: In “Run check now”, the default model now selects the first option whose display name contains `flash` (case-insensitive), and falls back to the first available model when no match exists.

---
## [0.9.10] - 2026-03-02

### Changed
- **Official-aligned wakeup execution stability**: Extended official LS startup wait to 60s, aligned client-gateway trajectory polling window to 60s, and switched `app_data_dir` to an official-style IDE-level directory (`antigravity`, overridable by `AG_WAKEUP_OFFICIAL_LS_APP_DATA_DIR`).
- **Wakeup gateway error-handling flow now mirrors long-running cascade behavior**: When trajectory status remains `RUNNING`, intermediate `errorMessage` steps are treated as transient and polling continues before final fail/success decision.
- **Antigravity plan badge rendering unified across account surfaces**: Centralized tier badge mapping via `getAntigravityTierBadge` and reused it in Accounts and verification detail surfaces.
- **Instance account selector ordering now follows Accounts sorting across all platforms**: Account dropdown ordering in multi-instance views now reuses each platform’s Accounts sort logic (Antigravity / Codex / GitHub Copilot / Windsurf / Kiro), avoiding cross-page ordering drift.
- **Accounts sort preferences are now persisted for all platforms**: Sort field and sort direction in all account pages now persist to local storage and are restored after restart.
- **Instances list sort preferences are now persisted per platform**: Instance list sort field (`createdAt` / `lastLaunchedAt`) and direction now persist by app type, so restart no longer resets instance list sorting.

### Fixed
- **Temporary upstream failures now self-retry once in wakeup path**: `temporary`/HTTP 5xx style payloads from `AG_WAKEUP_ERROR_JSON` now trigger a delayed one-time retry before returning failure.
- **Wakeup verification detail now shows backend user-facing error message**: Detail list now renders `lastMessage` (with truncation), so messages like `Agent execution terminated due to error.` are visible.
- **Wakeup tasks now respect privacy masking for account emails**: Masking is now applied in task cards, test selectors, history rows, and copied debug text.

---
## [0.9.9] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- **Built-in User Manual page**: Added a new `manual` page with scenario-based sections (quick start, dashboard, provider accounts, multi-instance, fingerprints, wakeup/verification, settings, and import/export + troubleshooting), keyword search, and expand/collapse controls.
- **One-click manual entry points across key pages**: Added manual shortcuts to dashboard/header areas and account empty states (Antigravity, Codex, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Kiro) to reduce first-run friction.

### Changed
- **Manual page now supports direct action shortcuts**: Each section can jump directly to related pages (Dashboard, Antigravity, Codex, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Kiro, Multi-Instance, Fingerprints, Wakeup Tasks, Verification, Settings), and can open Platform Layout from the guide.
- **Manual localization coverage expanded across locale packs**: Added `manual.*` keys and `nav.manual` labels across all supported locale files to keep guide/navigation copy consistent in multi-language environments.

### Fixed
- **Fixed permission-prompt attribution to Cockpit when launching third-party apps on macOS**: When launching Antigravity/Codex/GitHub Copilot/Windsurf/Kiro from Cockpit, protected-directory permission prompts are now significantly less likely to be attributed to Cockpit.

---
## [0.9.8] - 2026-03-01

### Changed
- **Refactored AccountsPages across 4 platforms (Codex/GitHub Copilot/Windsurf/Kiro)**: Introduced `useProviderAccountsPage` plus shared data extraction utilities to consolidate shared state/actions and reduce duplicated page logic.
- **Unified export UX across account pages**: Added `ExportJsonModal` + `useExportJsonModal`, aligned multi-account/single-account export flows, and added download-directory open capability permissions for the export modal flow.
- **Standardized OAuth copy and tab naming across locales**: Updated add-account OAuth labels/description copy to consistently use “OAuth Authorization”.
- **OAuth post-login now performs best-effort refresh**: Added post-login refresh passes for Antigravity quota and GitHub Copilot/Windsurf/Kiro token snapshots to reduce stale data right after authorization.
- **Path-missing guidance now carries retry context**: App-path guidance payload now supports `switchAccount` / `default` / `instance` retry intents so path save can continue the original user action.
- **Wakeup behavior switched to strict no-fallback mode**: Wakeup execution now requires explicit `project_id`; model fetch no longer falls back to hardcoded lists; scheduler no longer uses `fallback_times` outside the time window.
- **Instance window operation semantics tightened**: “Open instance window” now reports focus failures directly instead of auto-starting new processes.
- **Account identity matching is stricter**: Removed email-only merge fallback in Antigravity/Codex account matching paths; Codex-to-OpenCode auth payload now uses persisted `account_id` only.
- **Token parsing/refresh rules tightened for Windsurf/Kiro**: Windsurf token import accepts only API key or Firebase JWT formats; Kiro refresh now fails explicitly when refresh cannot be performed (no snapshot fallback).
- **Command trace pipeline added and made opt-in**: Added trace points for command EXEC/RESULT/SPAWN paths and kept it disabled by default unless `COCKPIT_COMMAND_TRACE=1`.
- **Quick settings quota-alert controls were componentized**: Extracted duplicated quota-alert UI logic into a shared rendering path in quick settings.

### Fixed
- **Launch-path validation now runs before switch/start execution**: When path is missing/invalid, backend returns `APP_PATH_NOT_FOUND:*` before stop/inject/restart actions.
- **Windows focus flow no longer hits `$PID` overwrite errors**: Focus scripts switched to a dedicated PID variable and retry loop for non-zero `MainWindowHandle` before calling focus APIs.
- **Windows executable-path matching reliability improved**: Added normalization for extended path prefixes (`\\?\`, `\\?\UNC\`), environment expansion, command-line exe extraction fallback, and sysinfo fallback diagnostics for path probe misses.
- **Path-missing guidance modal now matches settings visual style**: Reused quick-settings/settings shared styles for consistent title/path section/icon/typography/layout behavior.
- **Fixed Rust warnings in backend integration paths**: Cleaned warning points in token model and wakeup gateway reserved code paths so refactor branch warnings stay controlled.

---
## [0.9.7] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- **macOS repeated privacy permission prompts suppressed**: Replaced broad `sysinfo` process refresh (which fetched `cwd`/`environ`/`root` for all processes) with targeted `ProcessRefreshKind` requests that only retrieve `exe` and `cmd`. This prevents sysinfo from touching protected directories on other processes and eliminates the repeated Music/Photos/Documents permission dialogs on macOS.

### Changed
- **Kiro/Windsurf quota cycle reset time now shows relative + absolute format**: `formatKiroResetTime` rewritten to output `Xd Xh (MM/DD HH:mm)` style, consistent with other platform reset time displays. Sub-day granularity now shows hours/minutes instead of rounding to days.
- **Kiro/Windsurf cycle remaining time shows hours when under 24 hours**: Quota cycle remaining text now switches to `Resets in Xh` when less than one day remains, instead of showing `0 days`.
- **Kiro dashboard card quota display simplified**: Removed redundant used/total and left lines from the Kiro mini-card in Dashboard; now shows `resetText` or `cycleText` directly, consistent with Windsurf card layout.

---
## [0.9.6] - 2026-02-28

### Changed
- **Unified account presentation pipeline across five platforms and multiple entry pages**: Added a shared presentation layer for display name, plan label (raw value), quota metrics, reset text, and usage summaries, and reused it in Dashboard, Accounts, and Instances pages (Antigravity / Codex / GitHub Copilot / Windsurf / Kiro) to avoid multi-place divergence.
- **Token import UX now provides concrete input examples**: Updated token/JSON placeholder copy across locales and added token-format helper styling to improve readability in add/import modals.

### Fixed
- **Antigravity tray quota lines now follow group settings**: Tray submenu now aggregates by configured display groups (including model alias compatibility), so tray output matches grouped quota cards instead of raw per-model lines.
- **Tray refresh now reacts immediately to group-setting updates**: Saving/changing/deleting/reordering groups triggers tray menu refresh without requiring restart/manual cache actions.
- **Re-added accounts can reuse previous fingerprint binding after deletion**: Added deleted-account fingerprint binding persistence and lookup, so delete/re-add flows preserve original fingerprint association when available.
- **Antigravity plan badge display is now unified to normalized tiers**: Instance/account surfaces now consistently show `PRO/ULTRA/FREE/UNKNOWN` instead of mixed raw subscription-tier strings.
- **Antigravity token example helper copy now fully uses i18n keys**: Removed hardcoded Chinese labels in the token example panel so locale switching stays consistent.

## [0.9.5] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- **Windows wakeup no longer pops black terminal windows**: Added hidden-process flags for official Language Server startup and Windows CLI probes (`netstat`, `where.exe`) used by wakeup-related flows.
- **Local wakeup gateway intermittent transport failures now self-recover once**: Added local health-check preflight, transport error classification, and one-time gateway cache rebuild retry for recoverable local connection/TLS/timeout failures.
- **Local gateway requests now bypass system proxy and use a canonical loopback address**: Gateway/official-LS local clients now enforce `no_proxy`, and loopback base URLs are normalized to `127.0.0.1` to reduce proxy/interception-related failures.

### Changed
- **Verification copy and action labels switched from “Verify” to “Detect” across all locales**: Added/used `wakeup.verification.actions.runCheckNow`, updated run-hint wording, and aligned the verification-page primary CTA/title.
- **GitHub Copilot instances quota row now includes Premium requests**: Instance account quota summary now shows Inline, Chat, and Premium usage percentages together.

---
## [0.9.4] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed
- **Linux `.deb` blank/white window rendering on some environments**: Disabled transparent window by default (`transparent: false`) and added Linux WebKitGTK fallback (`WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1` when unset) to improve render stability.
- **Windows account-switch flow could hang while probing Antigravity processes**: Added a 5-second timeout for PowerShell process probing and automatic fallback to `sysinfo` scanning to avoid blocking the switch path.
- **Switch-success but launch-failure now becomes user-visible**: If account data is switched but launching Antigravity fails, backend now returns an explicit error message so frontend can show a visible failure notice.
- **Official LS resolution now follows configured Antigravity app path on all desktop OSes**: Wakeup/verification now derive LS from `antigravity_app_path` on Windows/macOS/Linux (with platform-specific extension/bin path and filename priority), and return unified `APP_PATH_NOT_FOUND:antigravity` when missing so existing path-setup guidance is triggered before execution.

---
## [0.9.3] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed
- **AppImage blank-page rendering on Linux (including Arch) caused by absolute asset paths**: Vite build output now uses relative asset paths (`base: "./"`), so packaged AppImage can resolve frontend JS/CSS correctly.

### Changed
- **Release-process documentation aligned to current completion rule**: Updated `docs/release-process.md` to treat `remote branch + remote tag` as release completion, while GitHub Actions/asset publishing remains a post-release async step.

---
## [0.9.2] - 2026-02-27

### Changed
- **Windows wakeup/verification now prechecks runtime readiness before execution**: Added a frontend + backend preflight gate so wakeup test and batch verification validate official LS readiness first, instead of failing after request dispatch.
- **Official LS path resolution now derives from configured Antigravity app path on Windows**: Runtime now resolves LS from the configured `antigravity_app_path` (`resources/app/extensions/antigravity/bin`), with deterministic filename priority and fallback matching in the same bin directory.

### Fixed
- **Path-missing guidance now triggers before wakeup starts**: When Antigravity app path or LS binary is unavailable on Windows, the existing `app-path-missing` flow is triggered immediately, preventing late 500 errors from gateway startup.

---
## [0.9.1] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- **Announcement system (desktop)**: Added a full announcement pipeline with Tauri commands, frontend store/service/types, and announcement center UI (list/detail modal, unread badge, mark-read, refresh, popup, image preview, and action handling for tab/url/command).
- **Announcement source controls for dev testing**: Added local override support (`~/.antigravity_cockpit/announcements.local.json`) and debug workspace source (`announcements.json`) for `npm run tauri dev` testing, with persisted read-state/cache files.
- **Repository announcement seed file**: Added a repository-level `announcements.json` with a welcome announcement and feedback action for quick local debugging and remote source alignment.

### Changed
- **Remote-first announcement strategy for normal users**: Non-dev/runtime builds now skip local override files and use remote announcements (with cache/fallback) by default.
- **Dashboard header action area**: Replaced the dashboard date display with an inline `Announcement` action button; announcement entry is now shown in dashboard context instead of global full-page placement.
- **v0.9.0 announcement content is now fully localized**: Added/filled title, summary, body, and action copy for all 17 supported languages in `announcements.json`, so users see localized announcement content per language environment.
- **GitHub Copilot usage rendering alignment (dashboard + tray)**: Switched usage parsing to structured snapshot semantics (`completions` / `chat` / `premium_interactions`), added `Included` handling, and added a `Premium` metric line/dimension in both dashboard cards and tray summaries.
- **Locale and copy coverage for announcement/tray semantics**: Added `announcement.*` keys across all locale files and extended tray copy mapping with `Included` and GitHub Copilot metric labels (`Inline` / `Chat` / `Premium`).

---
## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- **Dedicated Antigravity account verification workspace**: added model-based batch account verification with live progress, persisted verification history, per-batch detail view, and status filters (`All` / `Success` / `Verification required` / `Failed`).
- **Official-aligned wakeup/verification transport**: added a `local gateway + official Language Server protocol` flow using `StartCascade` / `SendUserCascadeMessage` / `GetCascadeTrajectory` / `DeleteCascadeTrajectory` for wakeup conversations and account verification runs.
- **403 verification quick actions**: verification-required results now expose validation URL and actions (`Verify now`, copy validation URL, copy debug info) for self-service verification.

### Changed
- **Unified model-list rule across wakeup surfaces**: wakeup task model picker, verification picker, and quota-related model display now all derive from official `agentModelSorts[].groups[].modelIds`; when unavailable, fallback is limited to the fixed 6 recommended models.
- **Antigravity model grouping reduced to 3 groups**: default display groups are now `Claude / Gemini Pro / Gemini Flash`; `Gemini Image` group and legacy mapping are removed to avoid duplicate group rendering.
- **Verification-page UX and privacy alignment**: added batch selection/deletion flow, closable notices, and privacy-toggle-linked email masking consistent with the Accounts page.
- **GitHub Copilot (VS Code semantics) display alignment**: `individual` plans are now normalized to `PRO`; usage is derived from `quota_snapshots.completions/chat/premium_interactions`; cards and tables now include a `Premium requests` dimension with `Included` display support.
- **Wakeup custom-time interaction refinement**: custom time keeps a `time picker + quick input` interaction; empty state no longer shows a default time value; custom time input is now applied to next-run preview and task save even if `Add` is not clicked.

---
## [0.8.13] - 2026-02-24

### Added
- **Independent Dock icon visibility setting (macOS only)**: Added a `Hide Dock icon` option in Settings > General so Dock icon visibility can be controlled separately from close/minimize behavior.
- **Localization coverage for macOS window-behavior options**: Added translation keys for `minimizeBehavior` and `hideDockIcon` settings across supported locales.

### Changed
- **macOS window-behavior config model split**: Added persistent `minimize_behavior` and `hide_dock_icon` fields in local config and wired them through Tauri system commands and WebSocket config updates; startup now applies the Dock activation policy from saved config.
- **Tag edit modal visual polish (especially dark theme)**: Improved dark-theme background, borders, chip/remove-button styling, and input/placeholder/disabled states.
- **OAuth auth URL parameter cleanup**: Removed `include_granted_scopes=true` from generated OAuth authorization URLs.

### Fixed
- **macOS Dock visibility now updates immediately after saving settings**: Changing the Dock icon visibility option now reapplies the macOS activation policy without requiring an app restart.
- **Language-switch config saves preserve new macOS window fields**: WebSocket language updates now keep `minimize_behavior` and `hide_dock_icon` when writing config, avoiding accidental resets.

---
## [0.8.12] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **One-command GitHub Release + Homebrew Cask publisher**: Added `scripts/release/publish_github_release_and_cask.cjs` and `npm run release:github-and-cask` to build a `universal.dmg`, upload assets to GitHub Release, and update `Casks/cockpit-tools.rb` (with `--skip-build` / `--skip-gh` / `--skip-cask` / `--dry-run` support).

### Changed
- **Startup app-path detection strategy**: On startup, the app now loads local config first, probes only platforms without configured paths, and staggers detection calls with a small delay to reduce bursts of system path-detection commands.
- **Release-process docs expanded for Homebrew flow**: Updated `docs/release-process.md` with recommended `universal` build flow, checksum generation examples, GitHub CLI/Rust target prerequisites, and cask update ordering notes.
- **Release workflow restores automatic Homebrew Cask updates**: `release.yml` now restores the `update-homebrew-cask` job to compute `sha256` from the published `*_universal.dmg`, update `Casks/cockpit-tools.rb`, and open a cask PR after release assets are available.
- **Auto-merge is limited to generated cask PRs only**: The release workflow now enables auto-merge only for Homebrew cask PRs created on `automation/update-cask-v*` branches (squash + delete branch), without affecting normal PRs.

### Fixed
- **Windows black console flashes during startup**: Fixed unhidden `cmd /c reg query` calls in the VS Code registry fallback path detection flow. Background commands now run hidden, reducing startup black-window flashes for some Windows users.
- **Brand names and plan/tier labels incorrectly localized**: Restored original brand/product names and raw plan labels in non-English locales, including `Cockpit Tools`, `Antigravity`, `Codex`, `GitHub Copilot`, `Windsurf`, plus `accounts.tier.*`, `codex.plan.*`, and `kiro.plan.*`.
- **Locale-check false positives for brand names**: Added brand-name allowlist entries to the locale validation script so English brand strings are not flagged as missing localization.

---
## [0.8.11] - 2026-02-22

### Changed
- **Antigravity quota backend fetch flow aligned with Antigravity.app**: Unified Cloud Code base URL selection for `loadCodeAssist` / `onboardUser` / `fetchAvailableModels` (Antigravity-style routing), passed `cloudaicompanionProject` through backend requests, and switched `onboardUser` to operation polling (`POST` + `GET`, 500ms poll interval). Local quota API cache is still retained, while the pre-cache backend flow is aligned.

---
## [0.8.10] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Windsurf email/password account import**: Added an `Email & Password` tab in Windsurf Add Account modal and wired Firebase sign-in flow to create local Windsurf accounts.

### Changed
- **Windsurf credits semantics aligned with monthly quota**: `availablePromptCredits` / `availableFlexCredits` are now treated as monthly total quota, and remaining credits are computed as `total - used`.
- **Password handling in sign-in flow**: Email is still normalized with trim, while password now keeps the original input (no trim) to avoid altering valid credentials.

### Fixed
- **Windsurf password-login i18n coverage**: Added missing `windsurf.addModal.password` and `windsurf.password.*` translation keys across locale files to prevent fallback language leakage.
- **Password-login log privacy**: Removed plain email output from Windsurf password-login logs to reduce PII exposure.

---
## [0.8.9] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **Account card tags are now visible across all five platforms**: Account tags now render directly on grid cards in Antigravity, Codex, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, and Kiro for faster visual identification.

### Changed
- **Card tag display is unified**: Tag chips now follow a consistent compact rule across platforms (show up to 2 tags with `+N` overflow).

### Fixed
- **Release checksum upload workflow no longer depends on local git checkout**: Added explicit `GH_REPO` context for `gh release` calls in the checksum upload job to avoid `fatal: not a git repository` failures.

---
## [0.8.8] - 2026-02-21

### Changed
- **Codex quota windows now follow window presence**: Codex quota rendering is now driven by `primary_window` / `secondary_window` presence instead of always forcing two fixed lines.
- **Codex window labels now use Codex-style rules**: Window labels now use unified dynamic formatting (`5h`, `Weekly`, `Xd`, `Xh`, `Xm`) based on actual window minutes.
- **Multi-instance Codex account selector now shows plan badge**: Bound-account dropdown/list in Codex instances now shows subscription badges (`FREE/PLUS/PRO/TEAM/ENTERPRISE`) alongside account emails to reduce free-plan ambiguity.
- **Manual update check now always shows feedback**: Clicking `Check Updates` now shows loading state and explicit result feedback (`up to date` / `check failed`) instead of silent no-op when no new version is found.
- **Release workflow now auto-publishes checksums**: GitHub Release pipeline now automatically generates and uploads `SHA256SUMS.txt` from release assets, removing manual checksum upload.

### Refactored
- **Shared Codex quota-window helper introduced**: Codex account page, dashboard cards, and Codex instances now reuse the same window-label/window-visibility helper to keep display logic consistent.

---
## [0.8.7] - 2026-02-21

### Changed
- **Unknown-tier rendering and filtering added**: Accounts with missing subscription tier now resolve to `UNKNOWN` (instead of falling back to `FREE`) in cards/tables, and the account filter dropdown now supports `UNKNOWN` as a dedicated option.
- **Unknown badge now uses warning styling**: `UNKNOWN` tier badges are highlighted in red to visually distinguish tier-identification anomalies from normal `FREE` accounts.
- **Quota modal badge consistency**: Quota details modal now always shows a tier badge, including `UNKNOWN` when subscription tier is unavailable.

### Fixed
- **No stale tier carry-over after refresh**: Removed backend behavior that preserved previous `subscription_tier` when the new quota payload had no tier, preventing old `PRO/ULTRA` labels from persisting incorrectly.
- **Tier-identification diagnostics improved**: Subscription identification logs now emit explicit `UNKNOWN` failure reasons (including status/body snippets and loadCodeAssist context) to distinguish API errors from successful responses without tier data.

---
## [0.8.6] - 2026-02-21

### Changed
- **Model group auto-classification now ignores version suffixes**: Added prefix/pattern matching for model families so Claude and Gemini variants are grouped by family (Pro/Flash/Image) even when exact IDs are not pre-listed.
- **"Other Models" cleanup for Claude/Gemini variants**: Claude Sonnet/Opus variants and Gemini x Pro/Flash/Pro Image variants are now routed into their target default groups instead of falling into `Other Models`.
- **Default Gemini group labels renamed**: Group display names were updated from `G3-Pro`, `G3-Flash`, `G3-Image` to `Gemini Pro`, `Gemini Flash`, `Gemini Image` for version-agnostic naming.

### Fixed
- **Legacy group-name compatibility**: Existing saved group settings with legacy `G3-*` names are automatically migrated to the new Gemini labels on load.

---
## [0.8.5] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- **Kiro account ban detection**: Automatic detection of suspended/banned Kiro accounts. When the quota refresh API returns a ban signal (e.g. 403 FORBIDDEN), the account is automatically marked as `banned` with the reason stored.

### Changed
- **Banned account UI**: Account cards and table rows now show a 🔒 `forbidden` status badge and a greyed-out card style to visually distinguish banned accounts.
- **Banned account action restrictions**: The switch button is disabled for banned accounts; the dashboard recommendation algorithm and quota alert suggestions automatically exclude banned accounts.
- **Bulk refresh skips banned accounts**: Refresh-all now skips accounts already marked as banned, reducing unnecessary API calls, and logs the skipped count.
- **Quota alert excludes banned current account**: If the currently active account is banned, quota alert checks are skipped.

### Fixed
- **Error vs. ban state separation**: Refresh failures (`error`) and account bans (`banned`) are now recorded separately, preventing all refresh errors from being misclassified as generic errors.

---
## [0.8.4] - 2026-02-19

### Changed
- **Kiro JSON import now supports raw account snapshots**: The import pipeline now accepts Kiro-style raw JSON objects (and arrays) with fields like `accessToken`, `refreshToken`, `expiresAt`, `provider`, `profileArn`, and `usageData`, then maps them into normalized local accounts.
- **Kiro import parser is unified with OAuth snapshot mapping**: JSON import now reuses the same snapshot-to-payload extraction path as OAuth/local import, improving consistency of email/user/provider/plan/quota field parsing.

### Fixed
- **Slash datetime parsing for imported expiry**: Kiro token expiry values in `YYYY/MM/DD HH:mm:ss` format (e.g. `2026/02/19 02:01:47`) are now parsed correctly during import.
- **Bonus expiry fallback coverage**: `freeTrialExpiry` is now recognized as a fallback source when deriving Kiro add-on expiry days.

---
## [0.8.3] - 2026-02-18

### Changed
- **Tray platform matrix expanded with Kiro**: Added Kiro to tray platform ordering/display and account-count aggregation, and introduced Kiro account summary rendering in tray menus (plan + prompt/add-on remaining with reset time).
- **Legacy tray layout compatibility for Kiro rollout**: When loading old four-platform tray configs, Kiro is auto-appended only for legacy default layouts while preserving user-customized visibility/order.
- **Raw plan/tier labels enforced in account pages**: Antigravity/Codex/GitHub Copilot/Windsurf account cards, tables, and filter options now show original plan/tier values directly (no localized remapping).

### Fixed
- **Auto-switch threshold boundary**: Account auto-switch trigger now fires when remaining percentage is less than or equal to threshold (`<=`) to avoid missing boundary cases at exact threshold.

---
## [0.8.2] - 2026-02-18

### Changed
- **OAuth callback server hardening**: Rewrote the local OAuth callback server to loop over incoming requests, silently ignoring non-callback requests (e.g. favicon), and only processing the actual `/oauth-callback` path. Added CORS preflight (OPTIONS) support and an explicit 404 response for unmatched routes.
- **OAuth CSRF protection**: OAuth authorization URL now includes a `state` parameter generated per flow; the callback server validates the returned state to prevent cross-site request forgery.
- **OAuth flow timeout & cleanup**: Added a configurable timeout for the OAuth callback wait; on timeout or failure the flow state is automatically cleaned up, and a user-facing retry message is returned.
- **OAuth redirect host normalization**: Changed OAuth redirect URI from `127.0.0.1` to `localhost` for broader browser/OS redirection compatibility.
- **Account identity matching overhaul**: Replaced the previous email-only account matching with a strict multi-factor identity matcher (`session_id` → `refresh_token` → `email + project_id`), plus a legacy single-email fallback for backward compatibility during upsert.
- **Google user ID persistence**: OAuth `UserInfo` now parses and stores the Google `id` field, writing it into account data on login completion.

---
## [0.8.1] - 2026-02-17

### Changed
- **Plan/Tier labels now use raw values**: Account-card and table badges across Antigravity/Codex/GitHub Copilot/Windsurf/Kiro now display original backend/local plan values directly, while keeping existing style mapping.
- **Overview tabs use fixed default labels**: Platform overview tabs (`Account Overview` / `Multi-Instance`) now render default text directly to avoid cross-locale mismatch from platform-specific translation overrides.
- **Platform names are fixed to source labels**: Shared platform label rendering now always shows original platform names (`Antigravity`, `Codex`, `GitHub Copilot`, `Windsurf`, `Kiro`).
- **Codex switch behavior is configurable**: Added `codex_launch_on_switch` to backend/user config and wired it into Settings and Quick Settings so switching Codex can optionally skip auto launch/restart.

### Fixed
- **Dashboard privacy consistency**: Dashboard account emails are now masked by the same privacy toggle used in account/instance pages, with focus/visibility/storage sync to keep masking state consistent.
- **OpenCode switch-token sync reliability**: Fixed a regression where GPT account switching did not effectively replace OpenCode login credentials in runtime scenarios, causing the app session to stay on the previous account. (#51)
- **Dashboard card layout balance**: Fixed the Antigravity account card width behavior to avoid obvious right-side whitespace in dashboard layouts and improve visual balance. (#49)

---
## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- **Fifth platform is live**: Kiro officially joins the supported platform lineup with unified management alongside Antigravity, Codex, GitHub Copilot, and Windsurf.
- **Core Kiro flows are now available**: OAuth/Token/JSON/local import, account switching, quota refresh, multi-instance lifecycle, and app path configuration are all included.
- **Platform-layer refactor**: Instance services, account stores, and overview tabs were unified into reusable platform abstractions to reduce future integration cost.
- **Key fixes in this release**: Hardened Kiro import ID validation against path traversal and filled missing locale keys to reduce mixed-language fallback in non-default locales.

---
## [0.7.3] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Tray platform layout persistence**: Added backend tray layout config storage (`tray_layout.json`) and command `save_tray_platform_layout` to save tray visibility, order, and sort mode.
- **Tray visibility control in layout modal**: Added `Show in tray` toggle in platform layout management and synchronized the related locale key across supported languages.
- **Expanded tray platform coverage**: Added GitHub Copilot and Windsurf tray submenus with account/quota summary and direct navigation targets.

### Changed
- **Tray menu architecture**: Refactored tray menu generation to dynamic multi-platform rendering, supporting auto/manual ordering and overflow grouping (`More platforms`).
- **Tray refresh trigger points**: GitHub Copilot/Windsurf refresh, OAuth completion, token import, and account switch flows now refresh tray content immediately; language changes also trigger tray rebuild.
- **Frontend tray event handling**: `tray:refresh_quota` now refreshes Antigravity, Codex, GitHub Copilot, and Windsurf in one flow; tray navigation now recognizes `github-copilot` and `windsurf`.
- **Platform layout sync strategy**: Added debounced frontend-to-backend tray layout sync on reorder/visibility changes and on initial app load.

### Fixed
- **Tray visibility filtering correctness**: Fixed tray platform filtering so disabled platforms remain hidden and the empty-state item appears when no tray platform is selected.
- **Log privacy hardening**: Logger now masks email addresses in log messages to reduce exposure of sensitive identifiers.

---
## [0.7.2] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Group management "Other Models" bucket**: Added an auto-collected `Other Models` group that lists non-default models discovered from account quotas.
- **Auth-mode model blacklist filtering**: Added blacklist filtering by model ID/display name in group management to exclude blocked Gemini 2.5/chat variants.
- **Claude Opus 4.6 mapping coverage**: Added `claude-opus-4-6-thinking` and `MODEL_PLACEHOLDER_M26` to default/recommended model mappings and wakeup recommendations.

### Changed
- **Group settings migration behavior**: Loading group settings now incrementally backfills missing default mappings/names/order while preserving user custom configuration.
- **Group modal data source**: Accounts page now passes live model IDs/display names into group management, improving model label display and "other model" classification accuracy.
- **Model display order alignment**: Account quota display order was aligned to include Claude Opus 4.6 under the Claude group.

### Fixed
- **Locale completeness for group settings**: Synchronized `group_settings.other_group` across all supported locales to avoid missing-key fallbacks.

---
## [0.7.1] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Cross-platform quota alert workflow**: Added quota alert calculations and event dispatch for Antigravity, Codex, GitHub Copilot, and Windsurf, with per-platform model/credit metric detection.
- **Quota alert settings surface**: Added quota alert enable/threshold controls in both Settings and Quick Settings, with synchronized i18n keys.
- **Global modal infrastructure**: Added reusable global modal store/hook/component (`useGlobalModal` + Zustand + `GlobalModal`) for cross-module prompts and alert actions.
- **Notification capability integration**: Integrated Tauri notification capability in app runtime/capabilities with macOS click-to-focus handling.

### Changed
- **Quota refresh behavior**: Refresh-all and refresh-current flows for Codex/GitHub Copilot/Windsurf now trigger quota-alert checks after successful quota/token refresh.
- **Alert payload model**: `quota:alert` payload now carries `platform`, and the frontend modal quick-switch action now routes to the correct platform switch flow/page.
- **Settings input interaction**: Refresh interval and threshold controls now use preset + inline numeric input mode with Enter/blur apply behavior.
- **Config model propagation**: `quota_alert_enabled` and `quota_alert_threshold` are now persisted through command save/get and websocket language-save paths.
- **Log retention policy**: Logger initialization now cleans up expired `app.log*` files older than 3 days.

### Fixed
- **Quota alert listener lifecycle**: Prevented duplicate `quota:alert` subscriptions caused by async unlisten timing in React effect cleanup.
- **Threshold consistency at 0%**: Runtime threshold normalization now honors `0%`, matching frontend options and user expectations.

---
## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- **Full Windsurf platform integration**: Added Windsurf account system end-to-end, including OAuth/Token/Local import, account persistence, quota sync, switch/inject/start flow, and multi-instance commands.
- **Windsurf frontend modules**: Added Windsurf account page, instance page, service/store/type layers, and dedicated icon/navigation assets.
- **Dashboard support for Windsurf**: Added Windsurf statistics and overview cards with quick refresh/switch actions, aligned with existing platform cards.
- **Platform layout capability**: Added layout management modal and platform layout store for platform ordering/visibility management in navigation.

### Changed
- **Navigation structure expansion**: Side navigation and routing were extended to include Windsurf and platform-layout entry points.
- **Settings model extension**: General settings now include Windsurf auto-refresh and app-path controls, plus corresponding quick-settings behavior.
- **Windows path detection pipeline**: App detection was upgraded with stronger multi-source probing, PowerShell `-File` fallback, and VS Code registry probing.

### Fixed
- **Path detection reliability on Windows**: Improved handling for empty/error-prone command output and reduced false-miss cases during VS Code/Windsurf path discovery.
- **Quota refresh fallback behavior**: Failed refresh now preserves the last valid quota snapshot to avoid clearing displayed quota to zeros.
- **Switch/injection robustness**: Improved handling and diagnostics around account binding and startup path mismatch cases.

---
## [0.6.10] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- **Privacy mode for screenshots**: Added Eye/EyeOff toggle and masking for email-like identifiers in Antigravity/Codex/GitHub Copilot account overviews and instance pages.
- **GitHub Copilot one-click switching pipeline**: Added default-profile VS Code switching path with token injection and restart integration.
- **Cross-instance window focus/open support**: Added and localized `openWindow` action and improved focus behavior by PID for Antigravity/Codex/VS Code instances.
- **Quota/switch diagnostics**: Added richer runtime logs and metadata outputs for refresh/switch troubleshooting.
- **Codex multi-team identity support**: Added account matching based on `account_id`/`organization_id` to support multi-team scenarios.
- **macOS distribution postflight hook**: Added Cask postflight logic to auto-remove quarantine attributes.
- **Release process templates/scripts**: Added release checklist/docs and helper scripts for preflight validation and checksum generation.

### Changed
- **Unified switch flow (overview -> default instance)**: Antigravity/Codex/GitHub Copilot overview switching now follows default-instance startup logic (PID-targeted close -> inject -> start).
- **GitHub Copilot flow alignment**: Overview switching and multi-instance startup now share the same injection/start semantics.
- **Instance lifecycle alignment**: Unified start/stop/close behavior across Antigravity/Codex/VS Code with managed-directory matching and PID tracking.
- **Windows VS Code launch strategy**: Switched to `cmd /C code` for `.cmd` wrapper compatibility.
- **PID resolution semantics alignment**: VS Code PID resolving/focus now uses `Option<&str>` semantics (`None` => default instance), matching Antigravity behavior and reducing default-instance mismatch edge cases.
- **Docs and settings guidance**: Updated README/security/settings guidance for new switching and path behaviors.
- **Localization synchronization**: Updated locale keys across all supported languages for Copilot switching, open-window action, privacy mode, and related error messages.

### Fixed
- **Error compatibility and messaging**: Improved non-success status handling paths and user-facing error propagation for refresh/switch operations.
- **PR review follow-ups**: Improved error handling, added SQLite transaction safeguards in injection flow, and fixed branding inconsistencies.
- **Build hygiene**: Cleaned Windows-specific warnings and removed/quieted stale dead-code warnings.

### Removed
- **Deprecated Copilot injection entrypoint**: Removed unused legacy wrapper in favor of the unified instance-based switching pipeline.

---
## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- **GitHub Copilot account management**: OAuth/Token/JSON import, quota status, plan badges, tags, batch actions, and account overview UI.

### Changed
- **Dashboard & navigation**: Added GitHub Copilot entry and overview panel alongside Antigravity/Codex.
- **App-path behavior**: Rolled back the recent app-path re-detect changes to restore the previous detection flow.

### Fixed
- **Windows build warnings**: Tightened platform-specific process helpers and avoided moved environment values.

---
## [0.5.4] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- **Codex OAuth login session API**: Added command set `codex_oauth_login_start` / `codex_oauth_login_completed` / `codex_oauth_login_cancel` with `loginId + authUrl` response model.
- **OAuth timeout event contract**: Added backend timeout event payload (`loginId`, `callbackUrl`, `timeoutSeconds`) for frontend-driven retry UX.

### Changed
- **Codex OAuth flow alignment**: Switched from code-push completion to login-session completion (backend stores callback code by session, frontend completes by `loginId`).
- **UI authorization flow**: OAuth link is prepared and shown in modal first; browser open remains explicit user action.
- **Timeout retry UX**: On timeout, the main OAuth CTA switches to `Refresh authorization link`; after refresh succeeds, it switches back to `Open in Browser`.
- **Timeout behavior**: Timeout no longer triggers automatic authorization re-creation loops; retry is user-triggered.
- **OAuth observability**: Refined OAuth logs to concise operational checkpoints (session creation/start/timeout/cancel/complete), removing verbose full-payload noise.

### Removed
- **Legacy Codex OAuth commands**: Removed `prepare_codex_oauth_url`, `complete_codex_oauth`, `cancel_codex_oauth` and related frontend/service fallback paths.

### Fixed
- **Duplicate callback completion risk**: Hardened frontend callback handling with session and in-flight guards to reduce duplicate-complete races.
- **OAuth timeout UI duplication**: Resolved repeated timeout error presentation in modal by consolidating timeout-state rendering.

---
## [0.5.3] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- **Blank instance initialization mode**: Added a new initialization option when creating instances (`Copy source instance` / `Blank instance`) so users can create an empty directory without copying profile data.
- **Uninitialized-instance guide modal**: Clicking account binding on an uninitialized blank instance now opens a guide modal with a **Start now** action.
- **Instance sorting controls**: Added sort field selection (`Creation time` / `Launch time`) and ascending/descending toggle in the multi-instance toolbar.
- **In-app delete confirmation modal**: Instance deletion now uses an internal modal (with top-right close action) instead of relying on the system dialog.

### Changed
- **Instance status model**: Added `initialized` to Antigravity/Codex instance view payloads and wired it through frontend state.
- **Binding safety checks**: Binding is now blocked for uninitialized instances (disabled UI + backend validation with explicit error).
- **Instance list layout**: Status is shown in a dedicated column next to instance name; actions column is now sticky/opaque so it stays visible on narrow windows without content bleed-through.
- **Dropdown rendering split**: Inline list account dropdown renders via portal (outside container), while modal dropdown keeps in-container rendering to avoid clipping and style conflicts.
- **PID visibility rule**: PID is hidden when an instance is not running.
- **Post-start delayed refresh**: Added delayed refresh (~2s) after start to reduce stale `pending initialization` state after first boot.
- **i18n alignment**: Added and synchronized new instance-flow keys across all 17 locale files.

### Fixed
- **Delete-confirm freeze**: Fixed a scenario where delete confirmation actions could become unresponsive.

---
## [0.5.2] - 2026-02-06

### Changed
- **Account switch binding sync**: When switching Antigravity account, default instance binding now updates automatically to the selected account.
- **Codex account switch binding sync**: When switching Codex account, default Codex instance binding now updates automatically to the selected account.
- **Instance account dropdown interaction**: Inline account dropdown now uses unified open-state control so only one instance dropdown is open at a time.
- **Instances page UI polish**: Refined list/table layout, inline account selector readability, and dark mode/responsive presentation.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-02-05

### Added
- **Wakeup scheduler backend sync**: Added scheduler sync command and backend-side history load/clear APIs.
- **Download directory helper**: Exposed a system API to resolve the downloads directory.
- **App path management**: Added Codex app path to general settings and introduced app-path detect/set commands.

### Changed
- **Wakeup history storage**: Moved history persistence to backend storage with higher retention (up to 100 items).
- **macOS launch strategy**: Prefer direct executable launch (PID available), fallback to `open -a` for `.app` paths.
- **App path reset**: Reset now auto-detects and fills the path instead of clearing it.
- **Account switching**: Update default instance PID after launch; emit app-path-missing events when needed.
- **Documentation**: Added multi-instance sections and image placeholders for Antigravity/Codex.
- **i18n**: Added new app-path related keys and ensured locale consistency.

### Fixed
- **macOS app selection**: Improved `.app` selection/launch flow to reduce permission errors.

---
## [0.4.10] - 2026-01-31

### Changed
- **Single account quota refresh**: Single card refresh now always fetches from the real-time API, bypassing the 60-second cache.
- **Cache directory isolation**: Desktop quota cache moved to `quota_api_v1_desktop` to prevent sharing/overwriting with the extension.

## [0.4.9] - 2026-01-31

### Added
