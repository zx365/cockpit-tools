### 8. Grok CLI Account Management

- **OAuth Authorization**: Supports xAI's official OIDC device flow and saves the account after browser verification completes
- **API Keys and Third-Party Endpoints**: Supports official xAI API keys plus OpenAI-compatible third-party `Base URL` and model IDs; configuration is written to an account-specific `config.toml`, while the key is injected only into the corresponding CLI process at launch
- **Import and Redacted Export**: Imports official credentials from the default `~/.grok/auth.json` or supplied JSON; account-page exports and generic account backups omit access/refresh tokens, cannot restore a sign-in, and require a separate official `auth.json` import when migrating
- **Real Account Switching**: Writes the selected account to the default `~/.grok/auth.json` in Grok CLI's official registry format while preserving other registry scopes in the file
- **Quota and Plan**: Queries the official billing/user/subscriptions endpoints, displays cycle, usage, product quotas, and the raw plan value, and records Grok Code access
- **Token Maintenance**: Supports automatic access-token refresh, refresh-token rotation, and quota alerts

#### 8.1 Grok CLI Multi-Instance

The default Grok CLI instance normally uses the official `~/.grok` directory directly and starts without setting `GROK_HOME`; managed instances use separate directories. API-key accounts, including third-party endpoints, always launch with an account-specific `GROK_HOME` so an official OAuth session cannot take credential precedence.

- **Account Binding**: The default instance can follow the current account, while each managed instance can bind a different account
- **Runtime Isolation**: Managed instances keep their `auth.json`, `config.toml`, working directories, and launch arguments separate
- **Terminal Lifecycle**: Generate or execute terminal launch commands, stop instances, and close all instances
- **Directory Protection**: Non-default instances are confined to the default managed root and moved to the trash when deleted; external paths from legacy configuration are only unregistered and are never written to or deleted

### 9. CodeBuddy Account Management

- **Trae Suite**: supports local import and switch injection for the default clients of Trae, TRAE SOLO, Trae CN, and TRAE SOLO CN; they are grouped under Trae by default
- **Switch Injection**: supports writing back local auth state using each client's real on-disk rules and launching the target client

#### 11.1 Trae Multi-Instance

Manage original Trae client instances with isolated profiles and lifecycle controls.

- **Isolated Profiles**: each instance uses its own user data directory

- **Import and Export**: Read encrypted local credentials from `~/.zcode/v2/credentials.json`, import or export JSON, and back up accounts
- **Quota View**: Query subscription plans and per-model quotas while preserving raw plan values
- **Batch Operations**: Tags, search, plan filters, export, and batch delete/refresh
- **Real Account Switching**: Encrypt and write the selected account back using ZCode's official credential format

## Security & Privacy (Plain-English)

These are the most common security questions answered directly:

- **This is a local desktop tool**: it does not require a separate cloud account for this project, and it does not rely on a project-hosted cloud account storage.
- **Data is mainly stored on your machine**:
  - `~/.antigravity_cockpit`: Antigravity IDE accounts, configs, WebSocket status, etc.
  - `~/.codex`: official Codex current login `auth.json`
  - `~/.grok`: the official Grok CLI default instance and current sign-in `auth.json`
  - `~/.zcode/v2`: ZCode encrypted credentials for the current official sign-in and quota cache
  - local app data folder under `com.antigravity.cockpit-tools`: Codex / GitHub Copilot / Windsurf / Kiro / Cursor / Grok CLI / CodeBuddy / CodeBuddy CN / Qoder / Trae suite / Zed / ZCode multi-account data, etc.; Grok CLI account details, managed profiles, and instance configuration are also stored here
- **Grok CLI credentials are not encrypted**: access and refresh tokens are stored locally as plaintext JSON and rely primarily on operating-system account isolation and local file permissions. On Unix systems, credential directories are set to `0700` and credential files to `0600`. Redacted exports contain no tokens and cannot serve as sign-in backups.
- **WebSocket is local-only by default**: binds to `127.0.0.1`, default port `19528`; you can disable it or change the port in Settings.
- **When network access happens**: OAuth login, token refresh, quota fetching, update checks, and other official API requests.
- **macOS privacy permission prompts**: after you start Codex/agent from Cockpit Tools, if an agent-run shell command accesses protected folders such as Desktop, Documents, Downloads, or Photos, macOS may show the request as "Cockpit Tools would like to access...". This happens because those commands are child processes launched by Cockpit Tools, so macOS attributes the request to the host app; it does not by itself mean the Cockpit Tools main process is actively scanning those folders. Grant access only when you trust the current agent task and the commands it is going to run. If unsure, deny the prompt or run the project from a normal working directory first.
- **Practical safety tips**:
  1. If you do not need plugin integration, disable WebSocket.
  2. Do not share your full user directory directly; redact token files before backup/share.
  3. On shared/public computers, remove accounts and quit the app after use.

## Settings Guide (Beginner Friendly)

If you want a stable setup with minimal tuning, follow the "Recommended" values.

### General Settings

| Setting | What it does (simple) | Recommended | When to change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Display Language | Changes UI language | Your native/comfortable language | Only if current language is hard to read |
| Theme | Light/dark appearance | System | Use dark mode for long night sessions |
| Window Close Behavior | What happens when clicking close | Ask every time | Choose "Minimize to tray" if you want background running |
| Antigravity IDE Auto Refresh | Periodically updates Antigravity IDE quota | 5-10 minutes | Use 2 minutes if you need near real-time updates |
| Codex Auto Refresh | Periodically updates Codex quota | 5-10 minutes | Same as above |
| GitHub Copilot Auto Refresh | Periodically updates GitHub Copilot quota | 5-10 minutes | Same as above |
| Windsurf Auto Refresh | Periodically updates Windsurf quota | 5-10 minutes | Same as above |
| Kiro Auto Refresh | Periodically updates Kiro quota | 5-10 minutes | Same as above |
| Cursor Auto Refresh | Periodically updates Cursor quota | 5-10 minutes | Same as above |
| Grok CLI Auto Refresh | Periodically refreshes tokens and updates quota | 5-10 minutes | Same as above |
| CodeBuddy Auto Refresh | Periodically updates CodeBuddy quota | 5-10 minutes | Same as above |
| CodeBuddy CN Auto Refresh | Periodically updates CodeBuddy CN quota | 5-10 minutes | Same as above |
| Qoder Auto Refresh | Periodically updates Qoder quota | 5-10 minutes | Same as above |
| Trae Auto Refresh | Periodically updates Trae suite account quota | 5-10 minutes | Same as above |
| Zed Auto Refresh | Periodically updates Zed quota | 5-10 minutes | Same as above |
| Data Directory | Where account/config files are stored | Keep default | Only for troubleshooting or backups |
| Antigravity IDE/Codex/VS Code/Windsurf/Kiro/Cursor/Grok CLI/CodeBuddy/CodeBuddy CN/Qoder/Trae/Zed/OpenCode App Path | Manually set executable path | Leave empty (auto-detect) | Change only if auto-detect fails or you use custom install paths |
| Auto-restart OpenCode on Codex switch | Sync OpenCode auth after Codex switch | ON if you use OpenCode; otherwise OFF | Enable for frequent Codex switching with OpenCode |

Notes:
- Smaller refresh intervals mean more frequent requests.
- If quota-reset wake-up tasks are enabled, some minimum refresh limits may apply (UI will show hints).

### Network Settings

| Setting | What it does (simple) | Recommended | Risk / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WebSocket Service | Real-time local integration for plugins/clients | OFF if not needed | Still local-only (`127.0.0.1`) when enabled |
| Preferred Port | Listening port for WebSocket | Default `19528` | Change only on conflict; restart required after save |
| Current Running Port | The actual active port | Read-only info | May differ if preferred port is occupied |

### 3 Ready-to-Use Presets

1. **Stable default**: 10-min refresh, WebSocket OFF (if no plugin), keep default paths.  
2. **Frequent switching**: 2-5 min refresh, WebSocket ON if needed, OpenCode sync ON.  
3. **Security-first**: WebSocket OFF, do not share user directory, remove unused accounts regularly.

## Installation Guide

### Option A: Manual Download (Recommended)

Go to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/releases) to download the package for your system:

*   **macOS**: `.dmg` (Apple Silicon & Intel)
*   **Windows**: `.msi` (Recommended) or `.exe`
*   **Linux**: `.deb` (Debian/Ubuntu), `.rpm`, or `.AppImage` (Universal)

### Option B: Install with Homebrew (macOS)

> Homebrew is required.

```bash
brew tap jlcodes99/cockpit-tools https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools
brew install --cask cockpit-tools
```

If you hit the macOS "App is damaged" warning, you can also install with `--no-quarantine`:

```bash
brew install --cask --no-quarantine cockpit-tools
```

If Homebrew says the app already exists (e.g. `already an App at '/Applications/Cockpit Tools.app'`), remove the old app and install again:

```bash
rm -rf "/Applications/Cockpit Tools.app"
brew install --cask cockpit-tools
```

Or force overwrite the existing app:

```bash
brew install --cask --force cockpit-tools
```

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting

#### macOS says "App is damaged and can't be opened"?
Due to macOS security mechanisms, apps not downloaded from the App Store may trigger this warning. The current open-source release flow does not yet use Apple Developer ID signing or notarization, so some macOS versions may show stricter Gatekeeper prompts. You can quickly fix this by following these steps:

1.  **Command Line Fix** (Recommended):
    Open Terminal and run the following command:
    ```bash
    sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Cockpit Tools.app"
    ```
    > **Note**: If you changed the app name, please adjust the path in the command accordingly.

2.  **Or**: Go to "System Settings" -> "Privacy & Security" and click "Open Anyway".
